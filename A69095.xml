            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Chriſtian Reader, thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that vntill the greater part of this Booke was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I thought I had giuen thee therein an anſwer to all that Doct. Biſhop had publiſhed vnder the name of his Second part. But being at Southwell not long ſince to doe my dutie to the moſt Reuerend Father, the L. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Yorke, his Gr. being pleaſed to vſe ſpeech to me concerning a point in the ſaid Second part, and ſhewing me thereof the booke it ſelfe, I perceiued a defect in that that I had anſwered, finding there handled the other queſtions of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Catholike which he had left vntouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his former booke, and whereof in the booke which I had receiued, there was
<pb facs="tcp:643:3"/>conteined nothing. In turning the booke I found a fault of the Print in the anſwer to the Aduertiſement, corrected in the end of the queſtions, whereby I preſently percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he firſt printed his vngodly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face here conteined, and the ſaid anſwer, &amp; for ſome cunning deuice (what it might be I leaue to thee to gheſſe) did thus publiſh the beginning and end of the booke, and left the middle part to be added at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure afterward. As it firſt came foorth, ſo I receiued it, enquiring after no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought I had receiued all, and knowing of no more, I haue written to no more, and had I knowen of the reſt before I had printed ſo much of this, I would haue ſuppreſſed this till I had confuted that as I haue done this. And heereby thou vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt the cauſe why I haue in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this booke taxed M.

               </note> Biſhop for the omitting of thoſe queſtions, becauſe hee himſelfe had then diuulged his book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, neither had I heard that he had written any thing of them: which taxations though now I cannot alter, yet by this Preface I reuoke, and doe wiſh thee to paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:643:3"/>them ouer, as if they were not there at all. Albeit where I might alter them I haue ſo done, and therefore recalled from the Preſſe the copie of my Preface and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement heere adioyued, wherein I had further noted that omiſsion; by meanes whereof, and for the adding of an anſwer to ſome few exceptions taken againſt mee by M. Higgons, lately reuolted from vs, ſo ſoone as I could get the ſight thereof, this booke hath been ſomwhat longer in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth than otherwiſe it ſhould haue beene. To which, being, though not by my default, thus maimed and vnperfect, I haue done ſome diſgrace by withdrawing from it the Dedication which I had intended; being notwithſtanding, good Reader, to intreat thy gentle patience to take this in good part, till God ſhall giue me opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie heereafter to adde the reſt. Heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſay, becauſe it ſhall firſt be neceſſarie for mee to returne a Counterproofe to Doct. Biſhops Reproofe, lately publiſhed againſt a little peece of my anſwer to his Epiſtle. Concerning which worke of his, (being ſuch as I preſume will in the end
<pb facs="tcp:643:4"/>make him odious and hatefull to all men that will take knowledge of it) I haue heere added ſome aduertiſement for the time, and giuen an anſwer to his Preface, wherein he hath taken vpon him to haue ſaid ſo much <hi>as may ſuffice to diſcredit me with all indifferent men,</hi> that whereas it will require ſome longer time to examine his Reproofe in that ſort as I intend it, I may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the meane time ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the edge, and remooue the ſcandall of it, whileſt by diſcouery of ſome of his iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (if at leaſt being ſo groſſe and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they deſerue to be called iuglings) the Reader ſhall be able to conceiue what he is in all the reſt. I will heere amplifie nothing further, but refer thee to thoſe obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I haue giuen thee thereof. God giue his bleſsing both to my writing and to thy reading, that we may both grow in hatred of Antichriſtian error, and in the knowledge and loue of the trueth of God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, I ſuppoſe it ſhall pleaſe thee better, if I doe entertaine thy ſtudious minde with ſome ſerious diſcourſe, than if I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to court it, with the ordinary complements of a curious preamble. Wherefore I purpoſe (by thy gentle patience) to handle here a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of maruellous great importance, which</hi> M. PERK. <hi>towards the latter end of his booke, laieth out againſt vs in maner of a moſt grieuous complaint: it is, that we</hi> Catholikes, <hi>among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other capitall crimes by vs (as he fableth) defended, doe bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and vphold the moſt haynous ſinne of</hi> Atheiſme. <hi>The man is not a little troubled to deuiſe wherein we doe maintaine any ſuch point of impietie: For, compelled by the cleere euidence of trueth, he confeſſed that we doe rightly acknowledge the vnitie of the God-head in the Trinitie of perſons: yet that hee may ſeeme to ſay ſomething therein againſt vs, he flieth vnto the threed-bare ragges of their common ſlanders of mans merits and ſatisfactions, and ſuch old ſtuffe: and ſtretching them on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:643:5"/>the tenter-hooks, yet one nayle further then his fellows, ſtriueth to draw out of them a certaine ſtrange kinde of</hi> Atheiſme, <hi>in this maner:</hi> The Roman religion makes the merit of the works of men,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.6.</note> to concurre with the grace of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ouerthrowes the grace of God. <hi>Item,</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the infinite iuſtice and mercy of God, but by conſequence both are denied: for how can that be infinite iuſtice, which may any way bee appeaſed by humane ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? And how ſhall Gods mercy be infinite, when we by our owne ſatisfactions muſt adde a ſupply to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt? <hi>There needs apretie wit (I weene) to vnderſtand how theſe points appertaine to</hi> Atheiſme. <hi>For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we defended, that the merit of the works of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with Gods grace, as two diſtinct agents, which wee doe not; for we hold that no works of man haue any merit, vnleſſe they ſpring and proceed from the very grace of God: but let that be granted, what kinde of</hi> Atheiſme <hi>or denying of God were this? or how followeth it thereof, that the grace of God (which is the principall agent, and farre more potent than the other) must thereby needs be caſt to the ground and foyled? this is ſo ſilly &amp; ſimple, that I know not what to tearme it: for he doth vntruely ſlander our doctrine, and that to no end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. To this ſecond cauill I anſwer in a word, that we teach (as he knoweth right well) the infinite iustice of God to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed no other way, than by the infinite ſatisfaction of Chriſts paſſion: And that our ſatisfactions are onely to pay for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall pains remaining yet due after the infinite are paid for by Chriſt. Now whether any ſuch temporall pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne remaine or no, after the ſinne is remitted, is a queſtion betweene vs: but to ſay (as</hi> M. PER. <hi>doth) that we be</hi> Atheiſts, <hi>and do denie God to be God, for that we hold ſome temporall puniſhment of man to be due, after pardon granted of his greater paine, is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly a very ſenceleſſe aſſertion. As wide from all reaſon is his third instance:</hi> That Gods mercy cannot be infinite, when by our owne ſatisfactions wee adde a ſupply to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. <hi>For if Chriſts moſt perfect and full
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:643:5"/>ſatisfaction, can well ſtand with Gods infinite mercy: farre more eaſely may mans ſatisfactions agree with it, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely leſſe than Chriſts. But the infinite riches of Gods mercy appeareth eſpecially, in that it pleaſed him freely to giue vnto vs (ſo meane creatures and wretched ſinners) his owne onely deare Son, to be our Redeemer and Sauiour; and both Chriſts ſatisfaction and ours are rather to bee referred vnto Gods iuſtice, than to his mercy: wherefore very vnskilfully doth</hi> M. PERK. <hi>compare them with Gods mercy. Neither is it poſſible to diſtill any quinteſſence of</hi> Atheiſme <hi>out of it, more than out of the former: nay, they both vprightly weighed, are ſo farre off from</hi> Atheiſme, <hi>or derogating any thing from Gods glory; that they doe much magnifie and aduance the ſame. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we hold our good works to be both meritorious and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory: yet doe we teach the vertue, value, and eſtimation of them, to proceed wholly from the grace of God in vs, whereby we be enabled and holpen to doe them; and not any part of the dignitie and worthineſſe of the workes, to iſſue from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall facultie or induſtrie of the man that doth them. So that when we maintaine the merit or ſatisfaction of good works, we extoll not the nature of man, but doe onely defend and vphold the dignitie and vertue of Gods grace: which</hi> Proteſtants <hi>doe greatly debaſe, extenuate, and vilifie, not allowing it to bee ſufficient to helpe the beſt minded man in the world, to doe any worke that doth not offend God mortally. Thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſuppoſed</hi> Atheiſme <hi>againſt God: now of thoſe that be (as he imagineth) againſt Chriſt the Sonne of God.</hi>

A man may here ſee in him the true I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and picture of a Popiſh Doctor, who ſeeing himſelfe vnable to contend further by ſound argument, to make his part good, betaketh himſelfe to this impudencie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of lying and ſlandering. Albeit in the firſt part thereof as touching his maine drift I will not at all repugne him, the ſame ſeruing to cleere them of an imputation of Atheiſme, charged vpon them by M. Perkins, but indeed amiſſe, as I cannot but ingeniouſly and freely confeſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is conceiued and drawen from forced and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent grounds, and therefore breedeth rather cauillation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, than accuſation againſt them. The crime of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme belongeth properly to them with whom God is either not at all acknowledged,

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:643:6"/>they are carefull, according to their maner, religiouſly to ſerue him. To theſe men then to impute Atheiſme, by a conſequence ſo far fetched, as bringeth all miſdeeming of religion within the compaſſe thereof, I confeſſe, ſtood not with that aduiſedneſſe and due conſideration which had been requiſite in a matter of ſo great moment and effect. Much rather ſhould M. Perkins haue ſought for Atheiſme in the practiſe and policy of them who haue been and are the maintainers of that Romane Hierarchy; who making gaine and aduantage of the ſuperſtitions, wherewith they haue intangled the ſoules of men, and reſoluing by all meanes to vphold their trade, haue in this emploiment quenched in themſelues all inward light and ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſomtimes openly profeſſing, and ſomtimes couertly diſſembling their deniall and contempt of God, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceipt of the nullity of all the ſeruice and deuotion that is done vnto him. Whereof we haue notable example in their
<note n="e" place="margin">See the Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiue of the Romiſh Church; the ſixt book; the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> Popes, of which diuers haue openly ſhewed themſelues to be meer Atheiſts, as Boniface the eight, and Iohn the three and twentith, who both denied the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule; as Clement the ſeuenth, who lying at the point of death confeſſed that all his life he had doubted of three things, whereof now he ſhould be reſolued; whether there were a God; whether the ſoule be immortall; and whether there be any life after this life: as Iulius the third, who commanded to bring him his Porke in deſpight of God: as Leo the tenth, who made but a fable and a toy of all that we beleeue concerning Chriſt. Many other of them haue there been of the ſame ſtampe, moſt damnable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, the very monſters of mankind, vtterly deuoid of all remorſe and conſcience of piety towards God, and thereby giuen ouer to all diſſoluteneſſe and abomination of wicked and finfull life. From them, and their appendants hath this poiſon ſpred it ſelfe, not only into the whole Court and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rome, but into all Italy, inſomuch that in the Italian tongue the name of

Thus Atheiſme, albeit it be not contained in the poſitiue Doctrine of the Romane Church, yet becommeth a ſequell thereof whilſt hauing no true grounds for the iuſtifying of it, and therfore being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſupport it ſelfe by carnall policy, it begetteth in the Politicians that practiſe for it, a ſtriuing and fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, whereby religion is quite baniſhed out of the heart, and only an outward colour remaineth for their maintenance of outward ſtate.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from the very grace of God.</hi> Where, not to queſtion what he meaneth by giuing the name of <hi>an agent</hi> to the merit of mans worke, anſwer him to the reſt, that his anſwer is vnſefficient and vaine, becauſe the Apoſtle knew well that we haue no workes wherewith to mooue God, but only ſuch as proceed from the grace of God; and yet reſolueth that Gods election if it be of works cannot be ſaid to be of grace. Whenceſoeuer the workes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:643:8"/>proceed, this rule ſtandeth ſtill moſt firme and ſure, that that cannot be ſaid to be freely giuen and for nothing, that is repaied to the merit of workes. But whileſt they will haue only workes of nature excluded by the Apoſtles words, and not the workes that are wrought by grace, they neceſſarily fall into the hereſie of the Pelagians that the election of grace dependeth vpon the foreſight of thoſe works which our free will ſhould doe by the help of grace. Which if they will not grant, as I trow they will not, they muſt perforce confeſſe that the Apoſtle heere excludeth not only workes of nature but generally all workes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. And the rather muſt they ſo confeſſe that they may not make the Apoſtle ſpeake ſo idlely as by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he doth; If it be of grace, then it is not of workes done without grace; and if it be of workes done without grace, then it is not of grace; as if the Apoſtle had had to doe with men who thought that by workes of nature they had obtained the election of grace. Againe that ſhift of theirs is ſo much the worſe, for that the works of which M. Biſhop ſpeaketh are not totally the effects of grace, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in part from the free will of man. For although he tell vs that <hi>grace is the principall and more potent,</hi> yet he will not grant vs that it is the whole <hi>agent,</hi> which not being ſo, looke what is attributed to the free will of man, falleth out to be the impeachment of the grace of God, ſo that eternall life being aſcribed to our good works, ſhall not be aſcribed wholly to grace, becauſe thoſe good works proceed not wholly from grace but partly from our owne free will. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hee any whit helped by that whereon he inſiſteth againe in the end of this diuiſion, that albeit the works bee partly of our free will, yet <hi>the dignitie and worthineſſe of the workes ariſeth wholly of the grace of God;</hi> for howſoeuer he wholly referre the dignitie of works to grace going before, yet he thereby taketh away the nature of grace from that that foloweth after, becauſe the latter grace cannot be ſaid to be freely giuen if it be due to the merit of any worke that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:643:8"/>is gone before. Albeit the vaine man ſhould ſee that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he quite ouerthroweth all merit of man; becauſe if the value and woorth of the worke grow wholly and onely on Gods part, then can it not be that man may be ſaied to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or deſerue any thing thereby (for what ſhould I deſerue of God by that that is wholly Gods and none of mine?) or if man doe truely merit, then doth not merit ariſe wholly from the grace of God.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond point, whereas he ſaith the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite iuſtice of God is no other way appeaſed but by the infinite ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and yet that there are temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due beſides for which we are afterwards to ſatiſfie by our ſelues,</hi> he ignorantly croſſeth himſelfe, and by one part of his ſpeech giueth checke to the other. For by what other iuſtice of God doe theſe <hi>temporall puniſhments</hi> fall vpon vs, but by his infinite iuſtice? what are they elſe in their owne proper nature but the firſt fruits of his eternall wrath and indignation againſt ſinne? And if there can no other be imagined but
<note n="p" place="margin">See heere of the queſtion of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. ſect. 3.</note> only his infinite iuſtice from which they proceed, then it is not in vs to pay ſatisfaction to God for them, becauſe by M. Biſhops owne confeſſion, <hi>the infinite iuſtice of God is no other way to be appeaſed but by the infinite ſatisfaction of the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Now if he will ſay that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and temporall effects cannot proceed from an infinite cauſe, he is controlled by the whole courſe of this world; becauſe all the proprieties of God which are infinite as they are immanent in himſelfe, yet in their tranſitiue and foren effects are ſtinted and limited to the modell and ſtate of the creature wherein the ſame effects are wrought.</p>
               <p>In the third point it appeareth that hee vnderſtood not what M. Perkins ſaid. Gods infinite mercy ſhewed it ſelfe in prouiding for vs an infinite ſatisfaction in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby to exhauſt and empt the moſt bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe depth of all our iniquity and ſinne. This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euery where nameth as the effect of
<note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 3.16. Rom. 5.8. Eph. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>the loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God;</hi> and therefore M. Perkins did not amiſſe to refer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:643:9"/>it accordingly. Now M. Biſhop, tooke it that M. Perkins had named Gods mercy, as requiring ſatisfaction, not as prouiding and yeelding the ſame to vs in Chriſt: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for an anſwer ſendeth vs a dreame: that <hi>if Chriſts infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſatisfaction may ſtand with the mercy of God, much more eaſily may ours.</hi> But let him conſider better of the matter, and tell vs at more leaſure how the mercy of God can bee ſaid to be infinite in the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, if it bee ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and reſtrained as that in reſpect of temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſame is wholly fruſtrate, and leaueth vs ſtill to make ſatisfaction for our ſelues. If the ſatisfaction of Chriſt be infinite, it muſt neceſſarily bee extended to all that is to be ſatisfied for. If it extend not to all that is to bee ſatisfied for, it cannot be called an infinite ſatisfaction. But of this enough in the queſtion of ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>He goeth on and telleth vs that their doctrine of merits and ſatisfactions is <hi>ſo farre from Atheiſme, or derogating from Gods glory, as that it doth much magnifie and aduance the ſame.</hi> Of Atheiſme I will ſay nothing; but it is vntruth which he ſaith that their doctrine doth not derogate from the glory of God: and a greater vntruth, that it doth <hi>magnifie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the ſame.</hi> The glory of God appeareth not in the pride of our merits, but in the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. For howſoeuer he colour the matter in ſaying that <hi>the value and eſtimation, the dignity and worthineſſe of our merits and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions ariſeth wholly from the grace of God;</hi> yet manifeſt it is that there is ſtill ſomewhat left for vs to reioice in, for that we by our freewill, as they teach, are the doers of the work. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that
<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>reioicing or glorying is excluded, not by the Law of workes,</hi> wherein wee haue our part, <hi>but by the Law of faith,</hi> whereby we beleeue that God doth all, according to his free promiſe for his owne mercies ſake. So in another place, hauing ſaid that
<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 2.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>wee are ſaued by grace through faith, not of our ſelues, it is the gift of God,</hi> he addeth; <hi>not of workes leſt any man ſhould boaſt:</hi> ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that boaſting cannot be excluded ſo long as the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:643:9"/>of ſaluation is aſſigned to our workes. Therefore God though hee could haue made vs fully perfect, and wholly free from ſinne, yet choſe rather, as S. Auſtin well noteth,

Biſhop heere would make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue out of the doctrine of the church of Rome, that the body of Chriſt may be in infinite places at once, that it may be together both in heauen and earth, with forme and without forme, both viſible and inuiſible, both circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and vncircumſcribed, that is to ſay by a plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, both that that it is, and that that it is not. Surely they would haue ſaied as we doe; If it be viſible, it cannot be inuiſible; or if it be inuiſible, it cannot be viſible: if it haue forme, then it is not without forme; or if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forme, how ſhould it be ſaid to haue any forme? both theſe cannot ſtand together. True ſaith M. Biſhop, in one and the ſame maner of exiſtence and being. And ſay I, if it be but one and the ſame body, it can at once haue but one maner of exiſting and being: for according to the ſame, or totally, to be thus &amp; not thus, cannot agree to one and the ſame thing. As for his inſtances whereby hee would take away the improbabilitie of this fancie, they are altogether ridiculous. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>when hee was transfigured, had another maner of outward forme and appearance then he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:643:11"/>had before; and after his reſurrection when it pleaſed him hee was viſible to his Apoſtles, and at other times inuiſible.</hi> And what then? Ergo Chriſts body may be in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once; it may together be both viſible and inuiſible, and whatſoeuer pleaſeth them. But a man may euen as well ſay: M. Biſhop is ſometimes hot and ſometimes cold, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſleepe, ſometimes awake; ſometimes ſober, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times merrie; ſometimes like a ſchollar, ſometimes like a ſwaggerer; ſometimes at Rome, ſometimes in England; ergò hee may at one time be together both aſleepe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, both viſible and inuiſible, both at Rome and in England, and in many places at once; ſo that though by Parſons procurement he were faſt laied vp in priſon, yet he might at the ſame time be perſonally before the Pope to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the appeale of the ſecular Prieſts and the exorbitant dealing of the Ieſuites againſt them. What, will he not call him a dreaming Sophiſter that ſhould conclude thus? Well then; let him for his paines take his fellow to him, and learne to argue more wiſely another time. But marke heere gentle Reader, that M. Biſhop maketh Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie a witneſſe of this matter. We haue thought heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore that they reſted the ſame wholly and meerely vpon the omnipotent power of God; and haue obſerued how their ſchoole-philoſophers when they ſpeake of relation of bodies to their places, do except this matter of the reall preſence as a matter of irregularity, not comming within compaſſe of the rules of Philoſophy, but farre tranſcendent aboue all their learning. Now M. Biſhop will make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it ſtandeth with good Philoſophy, and that all their Philoſophers haue all this while beene deceiued; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it is woorth the while to note in what termes and how warily he hath ſet it downe. <hi>The externall relations of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnto their places, do no whit at all deſtroy their inward and naturall ſubſtances, as all Philoſophy teſtifieth.</hi> You ſay well, M.

As a King by ſubstituting a Viceroy, or ſome ſuch like deputie, to whom he giues moſt large commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doth not thereby diſgrade himſelfe of his Kingly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as all the world knowes: no more did our Sauiour Chriſt</hi> Ieſus <hi>bereaue himſelfe of his power or dignitie, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſome part thereof vpon his ſubſtitutes.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:643:13"/>commandement, to haue offered his body and bloud daily in the ſacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe; <hi>what of that? ſee that question. Furthermore he ſaith,</hi> for one <hi>Ieſus</hi> the all-ſufficient media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of interceſſion, they haue added many fellowes to him, to make requeſt for vs: namely as many Saints as be in the <hi>Popes</hi> Kalendar: <hi>yea and many more too. For we hold that any of the faithfull yet liuing, may bee alſo requeſted to pray for vs: neither ſhall hee in haſte bee able to prooue, that Chriſt onely maketh interceſſion for vs, though he be the onely mediatour that hath redeemed vs.</hi>

Biſhop ſpeaketh as if he vnderſtood not what they meane) the Church of Rome offereth moſt high indignity to the Son of God. To take the points ſpoken of in order as they are; firſt they are iniurious to the kingdome of Chriſt, in that they giue the Pope authority to make lawes <hi>to bind in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which Chriſt only hath authority to doe.
<note n="b" place="margin">See hereof part. 2. pag. 17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>To bind in conſcience,</hi> is to tie the conſcience and inward man to an opinion of holineſſe and ſpirituall deuotion in the thing which is done, ſo as to account the ſame a worſhip of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whereby God is truly ſerued and honoured, yea and further, according to Romiſh fancies, the means of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, and the merit of eternall life. This whoſoeuer doth, ſheweth himſelfe a deceiuer and an Antichriſt, and the Pope in ſo doing is found to be he, of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prophecied,
<note n="c" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.4.</note> that <hi>he ſhould ſit as God in the temple of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:643:13"/>domineering in the hearts and conſciences of them of whom it is ſaid,
<note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are the temple of the liuing God.</hi> If Princes attempt to make lawes in this ſort, they are therein vniuſt and preſumptuous againſt God. Otherwiſe to ſpeake of Princes lawes, God himſelfe bindeth the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to yeeld the outward man in ſubiection to the Prince, when notwithſtanding the conſcience it ſelfe remaineth free as touching the thing which the Prince commandeth. I know that in outward things it is true which the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.12. &amp; 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>All things are lawfull for mee, I may doe all things;</hi> God hath giuen mee no reſtraint. To eat or not to eat, to weare ſuch a garment or not to weare it; to doe thus or thus it is all one with God: I am no whit the better the one way, nor the worſe the other way. Neuertheleſſe if my Prince command mee either way, God requireth mee to abbridge my ſelfe of the outward vſe of that liberty which he otherwiſe hath giuen mee and to performe obedience to my Prince, yet ſtill retaining inwardly the ſame opinion and perſuaſion of the thing in it ſelfe that I had before; and therefore content to tie my ſelfe outwardly to do thus, becauſe I know inwardly that it is indifferent to God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe thus or thus.</p>
               <p>The ſecond preſumption of the Pope againſt Chriſt is in taking vpon him <hi>infallibly to determine the ſenſe of holy Scripture.</hi> By which pretenſe he moſt impudently carieth himſelfe, bringing all abhominations into the Church, and corrupting all religion and ſeruice of God, and yet affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he doth nothing contrary to the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoeuer the words of Scripture are, yet the ſenſe muſt be no other but what he liſt. But well might we be thought to be without ſenſe, if ſo ſenſeles a tale ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with vs; a thing which in the ancient Church for ſo many hundreds of yeeres amidſt ſo many queſtions and controuerſies was neuer dreamed of. What needed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo much to buſie themſelues, and out of their owne exerciſe and experience preſcribe rules to others for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:643:14"/>out the true ſenſe of Scripture, when as a Pope with a wet finger could haue helped them to the certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth thereof? Yea why haue we ſo many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours of the Church of Rome, ſo various and diuers in their expoſitions and interpretations of Scripture; and why doth not the Pope rather by one commentary of his illuminated vnderſtanding reconcile all differences, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all doubts, and reſolue at once infallibly what is the certaine meaning of euery place? Are thoſe holy fathers loth of their labour, or are they ſo buſied in other or greater affaires as that they haue no leaſure to attend to ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles? Satisfie vs, M. Biſhop, as touching theſe matters; otherwiſe we muſt take this deuiſe to be as indeed it is the couer of your ſhame, the cloake of your apoſtaſie, which can no otherwiſe be ſhadowed but by this pretenſe: That the Popes ſenſe is the very trueth of Scripture, being not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding wholly repugnant &amp; contrary to the words. In a word, the Pope thruſteth out the lawes of Chriſt which are expreſſed in the words of Chriſt, and by his ſenſe ſetteth vp his owne lawes vnder the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To giue <hi>power</hi> to the Pope <hi>properly to forgiue ſinnes,</hi> as M. Biſhop doth, is a wicked blaſphemie and an Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an exalting of him into the place of Chriſt. When the Scribes ſaid within themſelues,

If M.

But how then did the ſame Clement the ſixt ſay, concerning them who ſhould die by the way as they were comming to his Iubilee at Rome;

Haue they mocked the world all this while, &amp; made men beleeue that the Pope not only hath power to deliuer ſoules out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory himſelfe, but can alſo impart the ſame to others, and is all come now to ſupplication and intreaty? Why, M. Biſhop can ſupplicate and intreat as well as the Pope, and what reaſon haue we but to thinke that God is as readie to heare his praier as the Popes, and ſo by that meanes he ſhall haue as great power ouer Purgatory as the Pope.

                  <hi>The Canoniſts do commonly defend the firſt part,</hi> ſaith the Mitigatour, that is, directly: <hi>but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Diuines for the moſt part the ſecond</hi> (that is indirectly and by conſequence) <hi>but both parts fully agree that there is ſuch an authority left by Chriſt in his Church.</hi> They agree in deed, but it is like Herod and Pilate againſt Chriſt.

Therefore his inſtance of a <hi>King ſubſtituting a Viceroy</hi> will not ſerue his turne; for hee that without any commiſſion from the King taketh vpon him to be a Viceroy, and vnder pretence thereof impugneth his Princes lawes, and maketh conſtruction of them at his owne pleaſure, and to ſerue his owne turne, howſoeuer he ſeeme to doe all in his Princes name, yet is indeed a traitour and a rebell to his Prince.

And in this he is defended by <hi>M. Whitaker,</hi> and preferred before all the learned Fathers of the firſt Counſell of <hi>Nice.

If then any of ours haue vſed any ſpeeches to that purpoſe, that God cannot doe that, that is the impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his eternall wiſedome and truth, and haue hence inferred that therfore he cannot <hi>ſet a body in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a circumſcribed place or any one body continuing but one in many places at once,</hi> they haue not hereby denied the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency of God, but only challenged the power of God from being made a cloake or ſhrowding place for mens preſumptuous fancies againſt God. To take away the eſſentiall condition of a thing, and yet to leaue it the ſame that it was, is a meere contradiction, and importeth a thing abſolutely vnpoſſible in it ſelfe. Now it is the eſſential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and property of a body to be circumſcribed and bounded within a place, ſo as not to remooue to another place without leauing that, and to take away this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to deſtroy the nature and condition of a body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay that a body may be without a circumſcribed place, is to ſay that it may be at once both a body and not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:643:30"/>a body, circumſcribed and not circumſcribed, which being a thing repugnant to the truth of God, to ſay that a thing is and yet it is not; it is that which it is not, and it is not that which it is, the deniall thereof is not a deniall of Gods omnipotency, but a reproofe of mens folly, who to vphold their owne deuiſes, ſticke not to broach paradoxes and ſtrange opinions iniurious vnto almighty God. They who affirme <hi>the vbiquity</hi> of the body of Chriſt, they likewiſe pretend for their defence the omnipotency of God. And what will M. Biſhop, I maruell, anſwer them thereof? Is not their allegation of Gods almighty power as ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as his is againſt vs? And will he be taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the omnipotency of God becauſe he ſubſcribeth it not to be a matter of Gods omnipotency to make a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of like infinity with himſelfe!

                  <hi>the proper ſeat of mercy is miſery,</hi> as S. Bernard ſaith. How then ſhould God elect men to be veſſels of mercy, but that we muſt firſt preſuppoſe miſery in reſpect wherof he would ſhew mercy? In a word, how ſhould we be ſaid to be

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:643:37"/>filthy cation a noiſome ſtincke, whereof the ſunne cannot be ſaid to be the cauſe, which with the ſame beames cauſeth from the violet and the roſe a pleaſing and delightſome ſmell, but the whole matter thereof ariſeth from the dead carkeſſe it ſelfe: euen ſo God, by the ſecret operation of his vnſearchable power, findeth meanes to draw foorth the ſin and wickedneſſe of man, which yet he in no ſort worketh in him, but the whole contagion and filth thereof ariſeth from the corruption of man himſelfe. And this we conceiue that God doth three manner of waies, by motion, by occaſion, and by deſtitution, in all which he yet ſtill remaineth pure and cleere. Thomas Aquinas ſaith very rightly, that,

                  <hi>God is the cauſe of euery astion as it is an action, and the vniuerſall beginning of euery inward motion of man.</hi> In ſinne therefore whatſoeuer belongeth to motion or action, God is truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to bee the cauſe thereof. But as in the halting of a lame leg we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the act of the ſoule whereby it mooueth, and the defect of the leg whereby it halteth, ſo are we alſo in ſinne to ſeuer by vnderſtanding the worke of God whereby man mooueth, and the default of man himſelfe in the ſame motion whereby hee ſinneth. Which notwithſtanding albeit in minde and conſideration they be ſeuered, yet in the ſubiect goe together; and as the motiue faculty of the ſoule exerciſing it ſelfe, the legge foorthwith by halting bewraieth it owne lameneſſe and imperfection, euen ſo it commeth to paſſe by corruption of nature in the whole man, that whileſt God moueth nature, man acteth ſinne, whileſt God cheriſheth nature, man che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth ſinne, and of Gods giuing ſtrength of nature, man gathereth ſtrength of ſinne. And thus the more God mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth vnto men either health and ſtrength and vigour of body, or dexterity and ſharpneſſe of memory and minde and vnderſtanding, ſo much the more doth he diſcouer the poiſon that is within them, without any default of his, but to the iuſt condemnation of man himſelfe that ſo diſgraceth and abuſeth the worke of God. Neither is it to be obiected
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:643:37"/>that God being, <hi>the cauſe of the cauſe, muſt needes be alſo the cauſe of the effect,</hi> becauſe as lameneſſe and halting is not an effect of going, but a defect; nor is to bee imputed to the motiue faculty of the ſoule as the cauſe of it, but to the default and debility of the leg; ſo neither is ſinne the effect of the act and motion which God worketh, nor is he the cauſe of it, but it is the prauity and obliquity of man who is the ſubiect of that motion. Now as by maintaining and moouing of nature, ſo alſo by miniſtring occaſions, God laieth ſtumbling blockes before the wicked whereat they fall and purchaſe further damnation to themſelues: Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſay, not as if they did giue occaſion, or were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues inducements to euill, but becauſe the iniquity of men euen of good taketh occaſion of euill, and turneth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God to it owne ſinne.

By deſtitution God draweth foorth mans ſinne whileſt he forſaketh him and leaueth him to himſelfe and to the power and tyrany of Satan to be holden of him at his will. For as in the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:643:38"/>of the ſoule the corrupt body groweth to more putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and corruption, ſo when God withdraweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from ſinfull man, his ſinne increaſeth more and more: and as a houſe, the pillars whereof are taken away falleth with violence, ſo doth he runne headlong and without any ſtay to all exceſſe and obſtinacy of ſinne. Yea and as a man being left naked and forlorne amideſt his cruell enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a prey and a ſpoile vnto them, ſo heere being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, Satan and his angels preſently ſeaze vpon him, they blinde him, they binde him as it were hand and foot, and carry him vp and downe whetherſoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them. We muſt vnderſtand that God, though in the beginning he ſuffered man to fall away from him and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deface in himſelfe the glorious image of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which he was created, yet vouchſafed of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo far to vphold in him both light of vnderſtanding and touch of conſcience as might ſerue to direct him in ſome ſort for morall and ciuill life for the preſeruation and maintenance of ſociety amongſt men. This direction of our life, God increaſeth and ſtrengthneth much by education and inſtruction, more by the knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of true religion, moſt of all by the grace of ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. Were it not that God in mercy had ſet theſe bounds &amp; bankes to reſtraine and hold in the rage and fury of vnlawfull and wicked luſt, the fall of man had carried him into all importunity and extremity of wickedneſſe and abhomination, and the ſtate of men had beene much worſe then the ſtate of bruit beaſts. When God therefore taketh away theſe props and ſtaies both of grace and nature, and leaueth luſt to it owne vnbridled and vnruly paſſage, and to the ſpurres of Satans malicious prouocations, what muſt needs follow, but that as the water vpon the rupture of the bankes breaketh foorth with all force, and violently beareth downe all that commeth in the way, ſo man ſetting a ſide all reſpect of conſcience, of modeſty and honeſty, moſt wretchedly demeaneth himſelfe; and the further God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                     <hi>they may fall from one wickedneſſe to another and not come into his righteouſneſſe.</hi> In all which notwithſtanding God worketh no ſinne in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:643:40"/>man, but that which God in iuſt iudgement doth by meanes either explicable or vnſpeakeable as I ſaid before out of Auſtin prooueth in man to the increaſe of ſinne; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that as ſore eies are offended and become more fore by the moſt comfortable ſhining of the ſunne: and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries <hi>per antiperiſtaſin</hi> doe one ſtrengthen themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, the heate againſt the cold, and the cold againſt the heat, euen ſo the very light of God and that that is pure and holy in him prouoketh the ſores of mans wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart more and more to feſter and corrupt, and his ſinne to ſtrengthen it ſelfe more and more in rebellion againſt God. Now heere againe this increaſe of ſinne muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a double conſideration. If we conſider it as ſinne, then is it mans onely worke ariſing wholly of that that is his owne. But if we conſider it as a puniſhment, it is of God who by iuſt iudgement prouoked it, from whom all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is iuſt, becauſe it is iuſtly deſerued by him vpon whom it is inflicted. And ſo generally conſider ſinne in it ſelfe, it is of man: but conſider it in his vſe, and there God hath a hand in it. Thus haue I truely declared the doctrine of our Churches concerning this point: and without the compaſſe of that that I haue ſaid there hath nothing beene deliuered by any writers of our ſide, and in all this God is fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and cleered, and the blame of ſinne reſteth wholly either vpon man, or vpon him by whoſe procurement man firſt committed ſinne. Now then to come to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which by M. Biſhop are obiected, we will firſt begin with Caluin, whom he nameth for <hi>the principall proctour and promoter of that blaſphemy.</hi> He pretendeth proofe heereof out of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> calling the ſame by the name of <hi>his Inſtitutions to hell,</hi> the wretch not knowing himſelfe to be vnder the power of darkeneſſe and in the bonds of hell, by ſeruing him who is the agent for the Prince of hell, and for that cauſe hath ſet it downe for a law that

He neuer read the ſtorie, and therefore out of his owne mother wit he thought it to bee a blaſphemie that Caluin ſhould ſpeake ſo. Marke I pray thee gentle Reader, the narration of this matter, as it is ſet downe by the holie Ghoſt. The Prophet Michaiah is brought in ſaying thus;
<note n="x" place="margin">1. Kin. 22.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſit on his throne, and all the host of heauen ſtood about him on his right hand and on his left hand, and the Lord ſaid, Who ſhall entiſe (or deceiue) Ahab, that he may go and fall at Ramoth Gilead?</hi> Heere is the originall and beginning of all, where God being highly offended at Ahabs wilfull rebellion and obſtinacie in ſinne is brought in reſoluing to take courſe to haue him further blinded and deceiued, that ſo he might goe a way, wherein iuſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould light vpon him. Which reſolution is hereby moſt cleere, for that God is ſet foorth as of himſelfe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king enquirie for one who might doe that that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be done. What, doth God aske <hi>Who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him,</hi> and yet was it not his will and decree, that hee ſhould be ſo deceiued? Well, the text goeth on and telleth, that <hi>while one ſaied one thing, and another another thing, there came foorth a ſpirit and ſtood before the Lord and ſaid, I will entiſe him. And the Lord ſaied vnto him, wherewith? And the ſpirit ſaied, I will goe out and be a falſe or lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. Then the Lord ſaid; Thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him, and ſhalt alſo preuaile; goe foorth and do ſo.</hi> Heere needeth no declaration at all. God enquireth for one to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:643:41"/>deceiue Ahab. The ſpirit offereth himſelfe, and telleth which way hee will effect it. God aſſenteth, and aſſureth him to preuaile; he biddeth him goe and doe as hee hath ſaid. And what, will M. Biſhop ſay, that God is heereby made the author of ſinne? God indeed ordereth and vſeth the ſinne of the diuell to puniſh the ſinne of Ahab, but here is nothing whereby it may appeare that God wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne in Ahab or in the diuell. The diuell is alwaies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to deceiue men, but being vnder the checke of the power and prouidence of God, hee can doe nothing but when and where it pleaſeth God to giue him leaue. When God then being prouoked by the contempts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpights of men, letteth Satan looſe, and in iuſt furie and wrath directeth him to doe to ſuch a one that which hee ſo much deſireth to doe: ſhall wee heereupon draw an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement againſt God, and take vpon vs to arraigne him as guilty of treſpaſſe and ſinne? If the text it ſelfe bee not ſufficient to informe M. Biſhops conceit in this behalfe, let him take S.

                  <hi>God hath a moderation and preſidency ouer the euill wills of men, that he ruleth and gouerneth them, wreſteth and boweth them by working inuiſibly in them, ſo that albeit they be euill by their owne corruption, yet by Gods prouidence they are ordered ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to one euill than to another, not by the poſition of the euill it ſelfe, but by the permiſſion of it.</hi> The explication hereof he borroweth from Hugo de S.

                  <hi>The euill will of man hath of it ſelfe the corruption whereby it is euill, but the order whereby in willing it tendeth either to this or that, is of God. In the will then is the corruption and that is euill, and thereby the will is euill: but in the act of willing there is both the corruption, for that it proceedeth from the will being euill, and there is order, for that of him that diſpoſeth it, it commeth that it tendeth to this or that. And when the act of willing is to this certaine thing, it is euill as it is to this, becauſe it commeth of an euill wil, but that it is to this rather than to that it is good, becauſe this is order, and commeth of him that well diſpoſeth it.</hi> Which words of Hugo doe notably illuſtrate and confirme that which hath been before ſaid of a difference alwaies to be made of the ſinne it ſelfe which is of man only, and the circumſtance and order of it which may not be denied to

He then that will weigh theſe ſpeeches of Bellarmine, and compare them with that that hath beene before diſcourſed of our aſſertion in this point, will plainly ſee that the very euidence of the truth made him ſubſcribe that doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which he profeſſeth to diſpute; and that he did but maliciouſly wreſt the ſpeeches of our writers, to make to himſelfe matter of controuerſie, where by plaine dealing he could finde none.

For all affections of the fleſh doe ſo boile in vs, as that they breake foorth to rebellion, or at leaſt haue ſome dregges mingled therewith: but Chriſt was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the feruour both of feare and griefe, as that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he conteined himſelfe within his bounds. Yea, as notes of ſong being ſundry, and different ech from other, yet haue no diſſonancie or diſcord, but doe make a goodly and pleaſant harmony; ſo was there in Chriſt a notable patterne of concord betwixt the wils of God and man, ſo as that they differed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conflict or repugnancie betwixt the one and the other.</hi> In which words when we ſee how holily Caluin accordeth thoſe differences which through agonie and anguiſh ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee in Chriſt, ſo as that though they ſeemed by his praier to draw backe from that whereto the Father had ſent him, yet indeed there was nothing in him repugnant to the will of God: what euill ſpirit may we thinke it was, that led M.

And doe not M. Biſhops
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:643:57"/>eies ſee him in this ſort, <hi>fleeting too and fro?</hi> By ſenſe and affection of nature he ſaith, <hi>Father, ſaue me from this houre,</hi> and yet by obedience he addeth; <hi>But therefore came I into this houre.</hi> By ſenſe of nature he ſaith, <hi>Father if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble let this cup paſſe from me;</hi> but by obedience hee yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Neuertheleſſe, not what I will, but what thou wilt bee done.</hi> Now though this be as cleere as the light, yet this wiſard like the dogge barking at the Moone, crieth out, <hi>Is not this pitifull impietie?</hi> and ſo bewraying his owne pitifull folly, hee goeth on to tell vs how all this agonie came to paſſe. And firſt he telleth vs <hi>that Chriſt of ſet purpoſe tooke that feare vpon him, and moſt willingly ſuffered that bloudie agonie.</hi> But this is none of M. Biſhops note, he borrowed it of Caluin; for Caluin ſaith as much, as wee haue ſeene before: onely let it be remembred, that heere hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that Chriſt did feare. Then he telleth vs, that <hi>Christ cauſed to himſelfe that bloody agony and conflict, by repreſenting vnto himſelfe the ſhame and paine of his dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſion.</hi> But when we ſee the martyrs with ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience and reſolution, to haue endured ſo exquiſit tortures, and farre beyond the bodily ſufferings of Chriſt, can wee imagine that the very conceit of his paſſions could driue Chriſt himſelfe into ſo great anguiſh and perplexity as in the Goſpell is deſcribed? And what? did Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before repreſent vnto himſelfe the dolours of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? not when he ſo often forewarned his Diſciples thereof? not when

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:643:57"/>did neuer before repreſent to himſelfe the ſinnes of men? Or ſhall we thinke that the bare repreſenting of mens ſins to himſelfe could cauſe him ſo great affliction and diſtreſſe? Yea and we would gladly know how to this repreſentation of mens ſins he will fit the praier that Chriſt vſeth, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> Hee ſaith, that <hi>heereby Chriſt would in euery part both of minde and body endure what he poſſibly could for the time.</hi> But what a vaine dreame is he in, that will talke of ſo great a paſſion in Chriſt, and yet make the ground thereof to be onely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination?

And did Chriſt ſo greatly ſhrinke backe from death, who knew that within three daies he ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Surely S.

He goeth on with diuers idle queſtions, onely to find his Printer worke, but to doe his aduerſarie no harme. <hi>If Chriſt ſo wauered, where was his conſtancie?</hi> I anſwer him, Chriſt wauered not, but by inuincible conſtancie of obedience ouercame that drawing backe which the pure affection of vndefiled na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture motioned vnto him. <hi>If he were ſo frighted, where was his fortitude?</hi> But the greater his feare was, the greater his fortitude appeareth in ouercomming that feare, becauſe great fortitude is not mooued with ſmall feares, but paſſeth them with contempt: and M.

This their peſtilent venime, they might haue ſucked out of theire good grandſire</hi> Luthers <hi>writinges, who vpon the very ſame wordes, doth make this goodly commentary.</hi> What ſhall we therefore ſay?
<note place="margin">In Pſal. 22. v. 1.</note> Chriſt to haue been together both the moſt iuſt, and greateſt ſinner: both the moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lier, and trueſt teacher: at the ſame inſtant, both the moſt highly glorying, and deepely deſpairing: both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the higheſt degree, and moſt miſerably damned. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we ſay this, I ſee not <hi>(ſaith this Oracle of the new Goſpel)</hi> how Chriſt was forſaken of God. <hi>See him alſo vpon the third chapter to the</hi> Galatians, <hi>where he vttereth yet more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeeches of Chriſt, to wit:</hi> that all the Prophets did in the ſpirit foreſee him to be the greateſt theefe, robber, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, adulterer, ſacrilegious perſon and blaſphemer, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liued. <hi>I could cite you diuers others of the ſame opinion, but I had rather note their extreame blindneſſe, who neglecting the ancient Fathers learned expoſitions of the holy Scriptures, were led away with ſuch horrible extrauagant conceites of our Sauiour, vpon ſo ſmall occaſion. For he at that very time hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Croſſe, declared himſelfe to be moſt farre off from all ſuch helliſh torments: yea, he ſhewed all poſſible ſignes of a moſt quiet and peaceable minde, praying for the ſaluation euen of his perſecutors (he was not then belike in doubt of his owne) promiſing alſo to the good theefe that the ſame day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe; wherefore hee doubted nothing of being there himſelfe: recommending his Mother vnto his beloued Diſciple, and him likewiſe to her; and to fulfill the Scriptures, both ſaying</hi> I thurſt, <hi>and citing euen thoſe very words, that they are ſcandalized at, out of one of the Pſalmes of</hi> Dauid: <hi>And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, aduiſedly conſidering all things belonging to his paſſion to be accompliſhed, commended his ſpirit vnto his Fathers hands; ſo that there could not poſſibly be more calme ſetled iudgement,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:643:60"/>more valiant conſtancy and reſolution, then there was. But what meant he then to ſay,</hi> My GOD, my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me? <hi>Forſooth nothing elſe, but to ſignifie, that in all theſe torments which he ſuffered, he had not any comfort or conſolation at that time from God, who is wont to giue extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aide and comfort to all thoſe, that ſuffer for his names ſake: but that Chriſt might (as he himſelfe deſired) be put to ſuffer all kinde of extremity, all manner of inward conſolation was wholly with-holden from him; which it pleaſed him then to expreſſe by manner of complaint in thoſe moſt pittifull words:</hi>

To ſenſe and feeling,</hi> I ſay, but not to faith, for by faith he ſtill ſaieth, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> If to ſenſe and feeling it did not ſeeme to him as if God did not heere him when he praied, why is he brought in ſaying in the next words of the Pſalme,
<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 22.1.</note>

It is not for man to take vpon him to be wiſer then God, nor for vs to ſay that this or that had beene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redeeme vs when we ſee what God hath decreed and done in that behalfe. It is true in deed that the dignity of Chriſts perſon gaue worth to his ſufferings, but we are to learne of the wiſedome of God what it was conuenient thoſe ſufferings ſhould be to which the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould giue that woorth, ſo that not the dignity of his perſon howſoeuer, but the dignity of his perſon in ſuch and ſuch ſufferings, certainely before determined of God, was to be the merit and purchaſe of our redemption and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So then neceſſary it was that Chriſt ſhould die for our redemption, though his death had beene no ſufficient price
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:643:66"/>therefore, but by the infiniteneſſe of his perſon. Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus therefore might very iuſtly and truely ſay, not that <hi>the incarnation and birth of Chriſt profited vs nothing, or could doe nothing,</hi> but that <hi>without the death of Chriſt</hi> they had profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs nothing, or could haue done nothing for vs, becauſe it was by his death, that God had appointed to redeem vs, euen as M. Biſhop againſt himſlfe confeſſeth, though his eies were not open to ſee it, that <hi>an hundred places of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ſcripture doe aſſigne our redemption to the bloudſhedding and paſſion of Chriſt. The Papiſticall Doctoures</hi> then, <hi>their Monkes and Prieſts</hi> are to be condemned, who vrge <hi>Chriſts incarnation and birth onely</hi> as a ſufficient price for vs, or doe ſtint the ſame as did Campian, that

                  <hi>when we ſpeake of the merit of Chriſt, we are not to place it as the firſt beginning, but we aſcend to the ordinance of God, which is the firſt cauſe, becauſe he meerely of his owne good pleaſure appointed him the Mediatour to purchaſe ſaluation for vs.</hi> In which words he acknowledgeth that Chriſt did verily and indeed purchaſe ſaluation for vs, but yet that it came of the good pleaſure of God, and his meere grace and mercy, to giue him vnto vs for a Mediatour to merit and purchaſe our ſaluation.

What audacious companions, and ſaucy Goſpellers were theſe? Yet their reaſon ſeemeth ſound in the way of their owne religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if they were moſt aſſured of the benefit of Chriſts owne iuſtice to be imputed vnto them, they could not be leſſe aſſured of their owne ſaluation, then they were of Chriſts owne. To conclude this point, conſider (good reader) how the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>(who would be thought to magnifie Chriſtes ſufferings excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) doe in very deede extreamly debaſe them. For (as you haue heard) they eſteeme very little of all the reſt of his life, beſides his paſſion: ſecondly, they make his paſſion without ſuffering of hell torments, not ſufficient to redeeme vs: thirdly, that all thoſe ſufferings put together, doe not in iuſtice merit the remiſſion of our ſinnes, but onely that of grace and curteſie God doth accept them for ſuch: fourthly, that when all is done, they deſerue fauour onely for a few of the elect, and that not to purge thoſe few, neither from all their ſinnes, but only to purchaſe them an imputation of iuſtice, to be apprehended by a ſtrong imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or rather preſumption, falſly by them tearmed faith. Is not heere a huge great mill-poſt, fairely thwited into a poore pudding pricke (as they ſay) by them, who after ſo high exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:643:69"/>of the all-ſufficiency of Chriſts ſuffering, doe in fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in a very few perſons it worketh onely an imputation or ſhadow of iuſtice:
<note place="margin">How Chriſt died for all.</note> but it agreeth very well and hangeth hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely together, that by the merits of Chriſts ſufferings in hell, (which are meere phantaſticall) theſe men ſhould haue created in them a phantaſticall faith, neuer heard of before their daies, to lay hold vpon a vaine ſhadow of an imputatiue and phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call iuſtice.</hi>

The Church may be viſible the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, when it is not viſible the latter, becauſe it may be ſeene and knownen that there are many perſons of ſuch deuotion though they be not ſeene in any aſſembly for the practiſe of their deuotion. In this ſort there haue beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome either few or moe, either one where or other, who to the world though with perill and loſſe of their liues haue giuen teſtimony of the truth of God. If we will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>viſible</hi> the latter way, we muſt conſider that the church it ſelfe may be ſpoken of diuerſely: either as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title of outward vocation and calling; or as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:643:73"/>the ſinceritie and truth of profeſſion and faith. There may be a church as touching outward calling viſible to the world, which yet doth not preſerue that integrity, truth of faith whereby it firſt became a church. There may be a people tied by couenant vnto God and by Sacraments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing in their aſſemblies to ſerue him, who yet vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruert the ſeruice of God, and depart from that way of religion which he hath taught them. In this outward ſtate and condition of the Church it is to be remembred which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith,
<note n="k" place="margin">Math. 22.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Many are called but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> the multitude generally taking vpon them to be called the people of God, when few of them are ſo indeed, in ſo much that the Prophet Eſay cried out concerning the Church of Iſrael,
<note n="l" place="margin">Eſay 10.21. Rom. 9.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Though the number of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant ſhall be ſaued.</hi> For euen in the profeſſion of true religion, and where the word of God hath publicke maintenance and ſtate, yet how few are there commonly who care to bring foorth the fruits thereof in holy conuerſation? Albeit it falleth out further alſo many times that this outward face of the church is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raied with the filth of manifold ſuperſtitions and idolatries, that true doctrine is reiected, and in place thereof humane traditions and inuentions are ſet vp and magnified, whileſt men neglect and forget the couenant of God and will needes vſe their owne wits for ſeruing him. Yea ſo far they proceed in the admiration and liking of their owne doings as that they hate the truth, and become perſecutours of them who continue conſtant therein, and refuſe to ioine with them to be partakers of their ſinne. Thus it came to paſſe in Iſrael by the ſinne of Ieroboam, and much more by the ſinne of Ahab, and in Iudah by the Apoſtaſie of Manaſſes, who brought abhomination into the temple of God, and ſet vp idols there to be worſhipped inſtead of God. At which time the caſe ſo ſtood as that Iſrael and Iudah hauing both caſt off the yoake of the law of God, &amp; broken the bounds that he appointed them, there was no
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:643:74"/>publike ſtate of true religion throughout the whole world. The publike ſtate and gouernement of the ſame church of the Iewes, the onely viſible church refuſed the preaching of Chriſt, preferred their owne traditions before Gods commandement, and pronunced ſentence of death againſt the Sonne of God. They onely were the people of God, the Church of God, but perfidiouſly they rebelled againſt God and refuſed to be guided by his word. But yet amidſt all this Apoſtaſie and defection of the church the calling of God did not become vaine, neither was his couenant of circumciſion without effect, but ſtill he had a remnant in whom he was glorified,

                  <hi>waited for redemption and for the kingdome of God.</hi> Now then where the church importeth them only that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of Gods true religion, there the church is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſible and ſomtimes inuiſible, viſible one where, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other where inuiſible. For true religion ſometimes hath publike ſtate &amp; maintenance, and the aſſemblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations for exerciſe thereof are apparant to all mens eies that whoſoeuer will may reſort vnto them. But ſometimes hypocriſie getteth the vpper hand, and vnder the name of the Church challengeth to it ſelfe the places of publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, driuing out from thence ſynceritie and truth, and ſuffering nothing to be done there but for it owne behoofe. Heere then the profeſſours of truth are faine
<note n="p" place="margin">1. King. 18.4. Heb. 11.37.38.</note> to hide their heads and to keepe themſelues in corners, and by ſtealth onely to aſſemble and meete together. It falleth out heere many times that they are forced with Elias
<note n="q" place="margin">1. Kin. 19.3.</note> 
                  <hi>to flie for their liues,</hi> and becauſe they are watched and waited for to be

In this caſe therefore the church, that is, the profeſſours of the true faith and religion of the Church are ſaid to be inuiſible, not for that they are meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mens eyes inuiſible, as is the Church in the firſt ſenſe before named, but becauſe it is not to bee ſeene in publike ſtate and aſſembly, in free &amp; open profeſſion, as in times of peace and liberty it is woont to be. For that otherwiſe they are viſible appeareth plainly in that they liue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſubiect to the malignity of their aduerſaries, to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reproch, to bonds and impriſonment, to cruell maſſacrees, tortures and death, all which they ſhould auoid if they were wholly out of ſight. But this inuiſibility of the church, is not to be conſidered onely in the church perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the church, the worſe part thereof the better,

Heere then God giuing way to the enemy the outward ſtate of the church is wholy ouerthrowen, the publike exerciſe of religion is altogether interrupted and broken off, and the members of the church though they be ſeene and knownen as ſuch a people, yet are not ſeene in the condition of the church, that is, aſſembling themſelues together to performe religion and ſeruice to their God. This was the ſtate of the church in the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Babylon, when Ieruſalem was burnt to the ground, the temple deſtroied, the people of God carried away into ſtrange lands and heere and there diſperſed amongſt the heathen nations. The like befell them by the tyranny of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:643:75"/>Antiochus euen in their owne land, their temple being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, their religion interdicted, and euery one commanded to be ſlaine that would not renounce the law of God. Now to apply all theſe things to the ſtate of the church of Chriſt, it was firſt oppugned by profeſſed enemies, who ſought wholly to root out the name of Chriſtians, and to abandon the faith of Chriſt vtterly out of the world. Thus did the Iewes firſt, and after them the Heathens, perſecute the whole profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and by the importunity of their cruelty did many times ſo obſcure and darken the face of the church, as that for the moſt part it was hardly to be ſeene. Whoſoeuer were found to giue open teſtimony to the name of Chriſt were martyred and ſlaine; the reſt for feare of the like danger either fled into wilderneſſes and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary places, or elſe had their meetings very couertly and ſecretly that they might not be eſpied. Yea their ſauage and barbarous fury ſo far preuailed as that they ſeemed to themſelues to haue gotten a perpetuall victory ouer the name of Chriſt, and did ſet vp pillars of marble as trophees thereof, whereof it is ſaid that ſome monuments are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining vntill this day. Thus albeit many thouſands there were who heere and there diſperſed and ſcattered continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſteadfaſt in the faith of Chriſt, and in many places co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly gathered themſelues together for the exerciſe of their faith, yet the Church to the ſight of the enemies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was inuiſible, neither could they in a manner take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any againſt whom their malice might any further proceed. But when by the prouidence and mercy of God the ſword of thoſe tyrants was wreſted out of their hands, this inuiſible church ſoone came to light againe, and began to enioie outward ſtate and honour, and the Saints who ſeemed to haue beene dead and buried in euerlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and ſhame, became renowmed and glorious in the world, and as they were indeed, ſo began they in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men to be exalted vnto heauen.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:643:78"/>whoore of Babylon, hath beene otherwhere plentifully ſhewed, and in ſome part hath beene alſo handled former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſecond part of this worke.

Now hauing thus at large inſtructed M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop what our doctrine is of the viſibility of the Church, I will anſwer him briefly as touching the other point of this cauill,
<note place="margin">The Church ſubiect to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> that by the ancient monuments of the Church it plainly appeareth, that many foule errors entred into the Church ſoone after the Apoſtles times; that <hi>whilest

I haue
<note n="o" place="margin">Anſwer to the Epiſtle ſect. 13. <hi>ex Euſeb. hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> before ſhewed out of Euſebius, how Egeſippus limited the Virginitie of the Church to the age of the Apoſtles, and that generation which with their owne eares heard the preaching of truth from them. I haue there ſhewed how the ſhifts and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Satan for corrupting of the truth which he began to practiſe euen in their daies, though they were then check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their authoritie, yet preuailed mightily when they were gone. The errours which then were, how farre they extended, and whether they were in other places the ſame that we finde them to haue beene in ſome, it is not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to vs; but manifeſt it is, that ſo cunningly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Satan conueied that poiſon into the Church, as that it hath neuer ſince perfectly recouered thoſe wounds that it receiued then: Yea Antichriſt the man of ſinne, the maſter of abominations, finding many of thoſe corruptions in the Church, hath bound them together as it were in a bundle, and by his edicts and lawes, hath obtruded and forced
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:643:78"/>them to be receiued as articles of true faith. But this, ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>doth mightily blemiſh the inestimable price of the most precious bloud of Christ.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>Forſooth it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not to be of ſufficient value to purchaſe vnto him an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting inheritance free from all errours in matters of faith, and abounding in all good works.</hi> But the effect of Chriſts purchaſe is to be determined by the wil of Chriſt himſelfe, and not by M. Biſhops wilfull and witleſſe dreames, by which it may as wel be prooued, that man is wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, as that the Church is without errour. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him briefly out of his owne words, that as the Church which Chriſt hath purchaſed doth not ſo abound in all good works, but that it is ſubiect to many ſinnes, ſo neither doth the ſame Church ſo abound in knowledge and truth, but that it is ſubiect to many errors. Chriſt intended not by his mediation to bring his Church in this life to full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: So long as ſhe continueth a pilgrim from her bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome and Lord, ſhe ſhall ſtill carie the marks of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and corruption. The Church in this world is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Moone, which is neuer ſo cleere but that ſome fret or ſpot of darkneſſe is to bee ſeene in it, and howſoeuer it ſeeme bright in one part, yet is obſcured in another. But it is worth the while to ſee to what iſſue M. Biſhop wil bring this conceit of his, if he be vrged to reueale the ſecret of it. For let vs queſtion with him: If the Church cannot erre, how is it that the Church of Epheſus hath erred and quite fallen away,
<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> 
                  <hi>which God purchaſed with his owne blood,</hi> and of which it was immediately that the Apoſtle ſaid, that
<note n="q" place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15</note> 
                  <hi>it was the pillar and ground of truth?</hi> Did not the Church of
<note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 1.6.</note> Galatia erre? The Churches of Corinth, of Philippi, of Theſſalonica, of Coloſſa, of Pergamus, Thyatira and the reſt, haue they not all gone aſtray? Yes, will hee ſay, theſe particular Churches may erre, but the whole Church vniuerſall cannot erre. But if euery part of the Church may erre, then ſurely the whole Church may erre, becauſe all the parts make the whole, which can be no other than
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:643:79"/>the parts are. We haue heereof example in the
<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 32.1.</note> Iſraelites, when the whole Church erred in ſetting vp the golden calfe, and in the Chriſtian Church, which was in a maner

                  <hi>the whole world groning,</hi> as Hierome ſaith, <hi>and woondering that it was become Arian.</hi> Well, he will ſay that the Church ſeuered and ſundred in the parts thereof may erre, but being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together by her Paſtors and Biſhops in a generall Councell it cannot erre. But this the former inſtances diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue; for the whole Church of the Iſraelites <hi>was gathered together to Aaron,</hi> &amp; the Chriſtian Church was aſſembled together by her Paſtors and Biſhops in the Councell of Ariminum to the number of foure hundred, who were moe than before had beene in the Councell of Nice, and yet decreed for the Arian hereſie. So was there a ſecond general Councel holden at Epheſus, which affirmed &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the hereſie of Eutyches, as there were alſo ſundry other, of which M. Biſhop will not ſay but that they did erre. True, ſaieth he, generall Councels may erre if they be not congregated by the authority of the Pope, but being the Popes Councels they cannot erre. But the Councels of Conſtance and Baſil were both aſſembled by the Popes call, and both theſe Councels decreed that the Councelis of greater authority than the Pope, and the Pope ſubiect thereto, which M. Biſhop for the Popes ſake will ſay is an errour, and by the Popes procurement the contrary hath beene ſince determined in other Councels. He will anſwer vs, that the Councell though it be aſſembled by the Pope, yet may goe awry if it become diuided from the Pope, but being aſſiſted and directed by him, it cannot conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, becauſe the Pope cannot erre. But we bring exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of diuers Popes that haue erred, as Liberius by the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie of the Arians, Honorius by the hereſie of the Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and ſuch like. Well, the Pope then, ſaith he, as he is a priuate man may erre, but as Pope, and in his conſiſtory and iudiciall ſentence hee cannot erre. But what, is the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:643:79"/>church now become an aſſe to carry a priuiledge for the Pope onely? To returne vpon himſelfe the skiruie terme that he hath vſed in the former ſection, <hi>Is not heere a huge great mill-post fairely thwited into a poore pudding pricke,</hi> that whereas we are told that it was the effect of <hi>the ineſtimable price of Chriſts bloud to purchaſe a church free from all errours in matter of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The word of God the rule and ſquare of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> we haue this great prerogatiue of the Church reſolued finally into a drunken dreame concerning the Pope, that it is he onely that cannot erre? This is the vpſhot of all, and to this iſſue the matter commeth, that the church may erre, the general councell may erre, be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons neuer ſo learned, neuer ſo faithfull, neuer ſo holy; onely the Pope though hee bee an ignorant beaſt, a very he hound and incarnate diuell, yet ſitting downe in his chaire of Peſtilence to decree a ſentence, receiueth preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like the Prophets of Apollo ſome Enthuſiaſticall impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby he pronounceth infallibly a truth, howſoeuer he himſelfe in his owne priuate opinion bee perſwaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.

But what Scripture, what Councell, what Father or ſtorie, or practiſe of the Church hath tied the interpretation of the Scriptures to the church of Rome, or the deciding of controuerſies to the Biſhop of Rome? And whereas their courſe in this behalfe hath no maner of iuſtification from the ancient Church, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him on the other ſide to alleage any courſe entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame Church for the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and iudgement of controuerſies, which is not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and practiſed by vs. Which becauſe he cannot do, he doth but waſte his wit by trifling in this ſort, and renuing idle cauils, which

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:643:80"/>more aduance them, why ſhouldest thou not giue ſentence on our ſide? They make Christ ignorant many yeares of his life: we hold him from the first instant of his conception, to haue beene repleniſhed with most perfect knowledge. They, that he ſpake and taught now and then, as other men did; and was ſubiect to diſordinate paſſions: We, that he was most free from all ſuch, and that he taught alwaies moſt diuinely. They make his very death not ſufficient to redeeme vs: we hold that the least thing that euer he ſuffered in his life, deſerued the redemption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worlds. They, that he died onely for the elect: we, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, though many through their owne fault, doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any benefit by his death. They, that thereby we are not purged from our ſinnes, but by imputation: we, that all are by the vertue thereof inwardly cleanſed. They, that Christ pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a Church conſisting of few, not to continue long, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many errours: we, that he eſtabliſhed a Church, that ſhould be ſpread ouer all the world, and that ſhould continue to the end of the world: viſibly, and alwaies free from any errour in any matter of faith. Finally, they hold that Christ left his holy word to the diſputation of men, not taking any certaine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the ending of controuerſies, that ſhould ariſe about it: we teach, that he hath eſtabliſhed a moſt aſſured meanes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all doubts in religion, and to hold all obedient Chriſtians inperfect vniformity, of both faith and manners. And becauſe I am entred into theſe compariſons, giue mee leaue to perſist yet a little longer in them. Conſider alſo (I pray you) who goe neerer to</hi> Atheiſme, <hi>either we, that thinke and ſpeake of the moſt ſacred Trinity, as the bleſſed Fathers in the first Councell of</hi> Nice <hi>taught: or they, who directly croſſe them, and by the nouelty of their phraſes, doe breed new, or rather reuiue old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies againſt it. Againe, who carry a more holy conceit of God, either they, who vpon light occaſion doe raſhly deny God to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe that, which they doe not conceaue poſſible: or we, that teach him to be able to do tenne thouſand things, that paſſe our vnderſtanding. Whether they, that affirme God of his owne free choiſe, to caſt away the greater part of men: or we, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:643:81"/>defend him to deſire the ſaluation of all men, and not to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any one periſh, vnleſſe it be through his owne default. Either they, that hold him to be the authour of all euill done in the world, and the Diuell to be but his Miniſter therein: or we that maintaine him to be ſo purely good, that he cannot poſſibly either concurre to any euill, or ſo much as once to thinke to doe any euill. Finally, whoſe opinion of him is better, either ours, that hold him to haue beene ſo reaſonable in framing of his lawes, that he doth by his grace make themeaſie to a willing minde: or theirs, that auouch him to haue giuen lawes impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the beſt men to keepe? If ſome</hi> Proteſtants <hi>doe ſay, we doe not maintaine diuers of theſe poſitions. I anſwer, that it is, becauſe they doe yet in part hold with vs, and are not ſo farre gone, as they doe wholly follow their new maſters: For if they did, then ſhould they embrace all the afore-ſaid damnable poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being ſo plainely taught by their principall preachers and teachers. Theſe therefore are to warne my deere Country-men to looke to it in time; and then (no doubt) but that all ſuch as haue a ſufficient care of their ſaluation, conſidering maturely whether the current &amp; ſtream of the new Goſpel carrieth them, will ſpeedily diſbarke themſelues thence, lest at length they be driuen by it, into the bottomeleſſe gulfe of flat</hi> Atheiſme.</p>

Now the matters whereof M.

I liſt not to follow him in his idle veine, but referre thee, gentle Reader, to the ſeuerall examinations of all his obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in which thou ſhalt ſee him one where leudly bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſlandering vs, another where wilfully miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, another where ignorantly condemning thoſe things which he is not able to diſprooue.

I meane the ſacred word of God. Master</hi> Gregory Martin <hi>a</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>man, very skilfull in the learned languages, hath diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about two hundreth of their corruptions of the very text of Gods word: and after him one Maſter</hi> Broughton <hi>a man of their owne (esteemed to be ſingularly ſeene in the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi> Greeke <hi>tongue) hath aduertiſed them of more then eight hundreth faults therein.

Heere is a large field of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:643:82"/>me to exclaime against ſuch corrupters and deprauers of Gods ſacred word: but I will leaue that to ſome other time, becauſe I haue beene too long already. But what a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe is this! they hold for the most aſſured piller of their faith, that all matters of ſaluation muſt bee fiſhed out of the Scriptures, and crie vpon all men to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and yet are the ſame Scriptures by themſelues ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly mangled, that their owne pew-fellowes crie out ſhame vpon them therefore: whereunto (if it pleaſe you) ioyne, that the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>haue no aſſured meanes to be reſolued of ſuch doubts and difficulties, as they ſhall finde in the ſame word of God.

Briefly to conclude this point, a great number of them hauing Gods word corrupted, for the lantcrne to their feete; and their owne dimne ſight, for their best guide: no maruaile, though they ſtumble at many difficulties in theſe high myſteries, and fall into very abſurd opinions, concerning the principall parts of them.</hi>

<note place="margin">Our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Scriptures vniuſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> deteſting nothing more than that the people ſhould be at liberty to read the Scriptures. Now becauſe they want meanes, thankes be to God, to pull the bookes out of their hands as heeretofore they haue done, therefore they betake themſelues to other ſhifts, and by diuers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and colourable deuices, they ſeeke to diſcourage
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:643:83"/>and terrifie ſo many as they can from the vſe thereof, but one thing ſpecially they haue laboured aboue others, to breed in them a iealouſie and ſuſpicion of our tranſlations of the Scriptures, as if the Scriptures themſelues meant nothing leſſe than by our tranſlations they ſeeme to doe. Now as the yoong fox learneth of the old, ſo doth M.

Pitifully corrupted,</hi> ſaith he; but how doth he know ſo much? for wee are out of doubt that he himſelfe neuer made triall of it. Forſooth Gregory Martin a Catholike man hath told him ſo. O pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull proofe! Iannes hath told Iambres, that Moſes doth but delude and deceiue the people. <hi>Gregory Martin,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a man very skilfull in the learned languages hath diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about two hundred of their corruptions of the very text of Gods word.</hi> We doubt not but Gregory Martin with them was a learned man if he did write for them; but yet he muſt giue me leaue to tell him that Gregory Martins diſcouery was ſo diſcouered, as that neither he himſelfe nor any other for him, had euer any ioy to meddle with it againe. His preſumptions and ignorances, and trifling childiſh follies were ſo laid open, though I know much more might haue beene done than was done, as that his learning failed him to make that good which he would needs haue to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a diſcouery of our euil. Which I do not ſpeak as if there were no faults iuſtly to be found in our tranſlations, but the faults that are to be found are Grammatical, not Doctrinal; ſuch as wherin the tranſlatours haue erred ſometimes by not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing exactly &amp; duly the ſignification of words, not wherby they haue brought in any new points of faith; ſuch as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatours themſelues finde in the new peruſing of their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, as our Iunius hath done, and yet ſee no cauſe of altering their religion in the amending of thoſe faults. Such
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:643:83"/>were the faults of which M. Broughton ſpake, who as M. Biſhop well knoweth, neuer found any cauſe by thoſe faults to depart from vs, or to ioyne with them; a man as he ſaith, <hi>ſingularly ſeene in the Hebrew and Greeke tongues:</hi> but it had beene to be wiſhed, that he had vſed that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather humbly and profitably to doe good to the Church, than curiouſly and proudly to gaine opinion to himſelfe. They are much diſtreſſed we ſee in the finding of faults, when they are faine to ſeeke teſtimony thereof from him whoſe reprehenſions are matters of diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to vs, but no benefit at all to them. And no other was his Maieſties intention, when out of his high and Princely vnderſtanding, hee cenſured our tranſlations in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at Hampton-Court. It is true that his Maieſtie there

                  <hi>profeſſed that hee had neuer ſeene a Bible well tranſlated in Engliſh, and the worst of all he thought the Geneua tranſlation to be, and therefore wiſhed that by the beſt learned in both the Vniuerſities, ſome ſpeciall paines ſhould be taken that one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme tranſlation might be had.</hi> But why did not his Maieſty thinke our Bibles well tranſlated?

Surely nothing leſſe, and therefore M. Biſhop doth but vainely ſpend his breath to talke of that which is no aduantage to him. And yet much adoe do theſe wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers make hereof, and babble of it no leſſe than as if a new tranſlation ſhould bee the very copy of the Councell of Trent, and with it the Pope with all his trinkets were to be brought into the church.

The glaſſe neuer yeeldeth the light altogether ſo cleere as it commeth immediately from the Sun, and the interleadding of it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that there is not fully and thorowout a perfect tranſparence of the light, and yet it giueth light ſo as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth abundantly for the diſcerning of euery thing, and for the directing and doing all the buſineſſe of the houſe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo tranſlations can neuer ſo cleerely and fully expreſſe the things that are tranſlated, as they are to be ſeene imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the originall from whence they are deriued. By
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:643:85"/>the vnperfect apprehenſion of the tranſlatours it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that they haue their ouerſights, as it were traces and barres of lead, thorow which the light of the originall text perfectly ſhineth not, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doe compact and hold together the body of the text, as it were the glaſſe thorow which the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe moſt comfortably ſhineth vnto vs, and by which we haue vndoubted and certaine direction for the whole worke and ſeruice of the houſe of God. There is in euerie language ſome ſpecial proprietie, the grace and ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whereof, no other language by any induſtrie of the tranſlator can atteine vnto. There are in the originals, but ſpecially in the Hebrew tongue, many words of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diuers ſignifications, of which it is very hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times to ſay which beſt fitteth to expreſſe the meaning of the place. Sometimes though the ſignification of the words be knowen, yet the phraſe and compoſition breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ambiguitie of tranſlation. By this meanes the wordes being ſubiect to diuers conſtructions, one interpreteth them one way, another another way, and neither can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll other, becauſe it is hard to ſay which is the trueſt way. Yea S. Auſt. doubteh not to ſay, that

By theſe and other occaſions, tranſlatours according to the gifts that God hath giuen them, vſe their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments diuerſly, one ſeeing that which another ſeeth not; one comming neerer to the truth in one place, and another

And heerein the incomprehenſible wiſedome of God moſt liuely appeareth, that hee hath ſo diſpoſed and ordered the Scriptures, as that this variety of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations enforceth no difformity of religon, but all tend to the maintaining of one and the ſame faith, contained manifeſtly in thoſe places of Scripture wherein all tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agree, and which without manifeſt and wilfull impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cannot be tranſlated otherwiſe. Whereby we ſee in our owne experience and continual exerciſe of the Scriptures, that though the exact meaning of a place be miſtaken, yet commonly it conteineth nothing in matter but what is warranted by another place rightly tranſlated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that place can bee taken for no other but the true word of God.

The <hi>grand ſignors</hi> of the ſtudents at Rhemes thinking good in their traiterous policy not long ſince to put foorth for the time a tranſlation of the new teſtament, albeit vnder a moſt hypocriticall pretence of religious care not to ſwarue from their copy, they ſought by ſtrange words and phraſes, and by diſmembred ſentences, to obſcure and darken the text the vttermoſt that they could, yet in thoſe places which for ſhame they could not otherwiſe tranſlate, haue left the ſame ſo apparant to iuſtifie our doctrine, as that they dare not ſuffer it to goe freely abroad without the poiſon of their annotations; and commonly they that doe reade the annotations muſt by no meanes preſume to touch the text. And hereby it appeareth what the cauſe is of their quarrell againſt our tranſlations, not for that they thinke them ſo faulty, as they pretend, but onely becauſe they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the vulgar reading of the Scriptures. Or if that be not the cauſe, why doe they not put foorth a true tranſlation of their owne, if ours be falſe, that all men hauing free vſe thereof may plainly diſcerne what the truth is? But the Reader vnderſtanding but the Latin tongue ſhall eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelfe in this behalfe if hee compare our Engliſh tranſlations with thoſe which ſome of their owne men, Pagnine, Arias Montanus, and others haue publiſhed in Latin, becauſe he ſhall plainly diſcerne that there is onely ſycophancy, and not any ſolidity or waight, in thoſe cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations whereby they ſhew themſelues agrieued at our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

Of their Bibles we haue heard before, and ſhall I now ſay to them to whom he ſpake before, If theſe Popes and Popiſh Biſhops and doctours had once deceiued you in a mony matter, you wold beware how you truſted them againe; and will you beleeue them ſtill, they hauing by their owne confeſſion ſo long deceiued you, both in your Church-ſeruice and in your Bible, commending the one to you as diuine ſeruice, and the other as Gods pure word, and ſince condemning them both? If he will thinke vs fooles to argue in this ſort, let him put his hand to his owne noſe and returne the imputation of this folly to himſelfe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that it is an ill bird that beraieth his owne neſt: and that hee ſhould firſt haue looked at home before hee had made this wiſe reaſon againſt vs. This only by the way, as being impertinent to this place, but by that that hath beene ſaid of tranſlations we may beforehand perceiue how faint and ſpiritleſſe M.

Atheiſm, <hi>I muſt come vnto their diuine ſeruice and worſhip of God, the third point that I promiſed to handle; becauſe he ſpared not to ſpeake his pleaſure of ours. First then, whereas a true, reall, and externall ſacrifice, is among all externall works, the moſt excellent ſeruice that can be done to the diuine Maieſtie, as ſhall bee prooued in the queſtion of the ſacrifice; which alſo hath euer ſince the beginning of the world, beene by the best men practiſed, to acknowledge and teſtifie, aſwell the ſoueraigne dominion that God hath ouer vs, as our dutifull ſubiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his almightie goodneſſe: the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>to make knowne vnto the wiſer ſort, that they are not Gods true loy all people, will not vouchſafe to performe to him any ſuch ſpeciall ſeruice, as to ſacrifice in his honour: nay they are fallen ſo farre out with this principall part of Gods true worſhip, that they do in deſpight of it, powre out moſt vile reproches againſt the daily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church, which conteineth the bleſſed body and moſt pretious bloud of our redeemer</hi> IESVS <hi>Chriſt. Secondly, of ſeauen Sacraments (inſtituted by our Sauiour, both to exhibite honour to God, and to ſanctifie our ſoules) they doe flatly reiect fiue of them: And do further (as much as in them lieth) extinguiſh the vertue and efficacy of the other two. For they hold Baptiſme not to be the true inſtrument all cauſe of remiſſion of our ſinnes, and of the infuſion of grace in our ſoules; but only to bee the ſigne and ſeale thereof. And in ſteade of Chriſts ſacred body, really giuen to all</hi> Catholikes <hi>in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar, to their exceeding comfort and dignity, the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>muſt be content to take vp with a bitte of bread, and with a ſup of wine: a most pittifull exchange, for ſo heauenly a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:643:88"/>banquet. They doe daily feele (and I would to God they had grace to vnderſtand) what a want they haue of the Sacrament of Confeſſion, which is the moſt ſoueraigne ſalue of the world, to cure all the deadly and dangerous woundes of the ſoule. Ah how careleſly doe they daily heape ſinne vpon ſin, and ſuffer them to lie feſtring in their breaſts euen till death, for lacke of laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them inſeaſon by true and due confeſſion! Beſides, at the point of death, when the Diuell is moſt buſie to aſſault vs, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring then to make vs his owne for euer, there is amongst them no</hi> anointing of the ſicke with holy oile <hi>in the name of our Lord, (as</hi> S.

Now as concerning the place where their diuine ſeruice is ſaid: if goodly ſtately Churches had not beene by men of our religion built to their handes, in what ſimple cotes (trow you) would their key-cold deuotion haue beene content to ſerue their Lord? if one Church or great ſteeple, by any miſhap fall into vtter ruine, a collection

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:643:92"/>Chriſt. Such praying wee are content indeede to leaue to their Prieſts, and what they win thereby they ſhall haue our good will to weare. Whereas he ſaith that <hi>our ſeruice is a mingle-mangle tranſlated out of the old Portaiſe and Maſſe-booke,</hi> he forgat to vſe his words aright.

Therefore the compoſers of our Church ſeruice, becauſe they minded not to ſet vp a new Church, but only to reforme the Church, did take a courſe accordingly, not to ſet foorth another Seruice, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that that was, and to expunge thoſe corruptions which the abomination of deſolation had brought into it. They gathered the pearles out of the mucke whereinto they were throwen: what was conſonant to the word of God and agreeable to the example of the pureſt antiquity, that they made choice of, and haue tranſlated it into our booke, the other filth they left for ſwine, that will needs ſo be, to wallow in. The performance of our Seruice, I doubt not, wanteth much of that deuotion and thankefulneſſe which wee ſhould yeeld to God, who ſo graciouſly hath vouchſafed vs the light of his truth; but yet ill doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme a cripple to vpbraide another with a lame leg.

We haue therefore pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe the Crucifix, as being made an Idoll and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in ſtead of Chriſt, and in place therof for the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Churches we haue ſet vp the Kings armes, as being the defender of the faith of Chriſt. But <hi>we haue taught that it is againſt Gods commandement to ſet vp in Churches any ſuch Images as are in the Kings armes.</hi> But therein he ſaith vntruly, for we haue alwaies taught, that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt table concerne matter of religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and require the ſame to be performed to God only. The ſecond commandement therefore condemneth all Images that are made or ſet vp for exerciſe of religion; but hiſtoricall and ciuill vſe of Images it condemneth not, neither doth he finde any one of vs ſo to expound it, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to forbid the making of any Image, as he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnderſtood by our conſent ſet down by M. Perkins in the beginning of that queſtion. Further, he queſtioneth out
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:643:95"/>of his ſweet womanly deuotion, <hi>is it not a pitifull blindneſſe to thinke that the pictures of Lions and Libberts doe better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the houſe of God, than the Image of his owne Sonne and of his faithfull ſeruants?</hi> But doth his wiſdome thinke that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon was blinde when he made in the Temple of God the pictures and Images of Lions and Buls, of Flowers and Palme-trees, and made no Images of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, and other holy men that were before him? It was neuer ſeene, but in times notoriouſly condemned
<note n="c" place="margin">See of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſect. 17.</note> for Idolatry, that euer the Image of any man was ſet vp in the Temple of God: and is not this poore man in a pitifull caſe, that holdeth all thoſe iuſt and righteous Fathers that liued in thoſe times to haue beene but blinde men, becauſe they would not be partakers of his folly? They are therefore ſuch wiſe men as hee himſelfe is that make the collection that he doth: but as for vs we yeeld ſuch honour and ſeruice to our Prince as God requireth vs to do, not ſetting vp our Prince in the place of God as they do the Pope, but obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him vnder God and for Gods ſake, whom God hath placed ouer vs, and who ſeeketh no otherwiſe to gouerne vs but by the word of God.</p>

But when they ſaw vs recalling them to the ancient order of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and thereby training them to the knowledge of God, and of faith towards him, they held it neceſſarie for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the world, that they themſelues ſhould make ſome ſhew of doing the like, and thereupon in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, tooke order for a Catechiſme to bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, though they neuer meant to make any great vſe of it, but onely where neceſſitie ſhould enforce them for the countermining of our labours, and the ſtaying of manie, whom otherwiſe the deſire of learning and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, would haue caried away from them.

For many Churches were there, and many Biſhops and Paſtours of Churches, of whom no memoriall is come vnto vs; many whom we finde other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reported of than was true, by the corrupting of thoſe writings which they left vnto the Church, and ſuborning other counterfets in their ſtead; many, who haue deliuered ſome exorbitant opinions, of which notwithſtanding it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not that they had publike approbation in the Church; many, who haue left ſo little in record as touching points of faith, as that it is hard by them to eſteeme what the doctrine of the Church was. As for the corruptions whereof we ſpeake, there are many of them ſuch, as that I doe not thinke M.

                  <hi>But let vs deſcend to the particulars, wherein the truth will appeare more plainely. Thus beginneth</hi> Maſter PERKINS <hi>with the Creede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all it muſt be conſidered, that ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall doctrines beleeued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Vicar of Chriſt, and head of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church: that there is a fire of Purgatory: that Images of God and Saints, are to be placed in the Church, and worſhipped: that Praier is to be made to Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: that there is a propitiatory ſacrifice daily offered in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead. Theſe points are of that moment, that without them the <hi>Roman</hi> religion cannot ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet marke the Apoſtles Creed, which hath beene thought to containe all neceſſary points of religion to be beleeued, and hath therefore beene called the <hi>key and rule of faith:</hi> This Creede <hi>(I ſay)</hi> hath
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:643:104"/>not any of theſe points, nor the expoſitions made thereof by the ancient Fathers, nor any other Creed or confeſſion of faith made by any Councell or Church, for the ſpace of many hundred yeeres. This is a plaine proofe to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, that theſe bee new articles of faith, neuer knowen in the Apoſtolike Church: and that the Fathers and Councels could not finde any ſuch articles of faith in the bookes of the old and new Teſtament. Anſwer is made, that all theſe points of doctrine are beleeued vnder the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>(I beleeue the Catholike Church:)</hi> the meaning whereof they will haue to be this, I beleeue all things which the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church holdeth and teacheth to be beleeued. If this bee as they ſay, wee muſt beleeue in the Church: that is, put our confidence in the Church, for the manifeſtation and the certainety of all doctrine neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation. And thus the eternall truth of God the Creatour, ſhall depend vpon the determination of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And the written word of God in this reſpect is made inſufficient, as though it had not plainely reuealed all points of doctrine pertaining to ſaluation. And the ancient Churches haue beene farre ouer-ſecene, that did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the former points to be beleeued as articles of faith, but left them to theſe latter times. <hi>Thus farre</hi> Maſter PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS: <hi>Wherein are hudled vp many things confuſedly: I will anſwere briefly and diſtinctly to euery point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt is, that</hi> in the Apoſtles Creede are contained all points of religion neceſſary to be beleeued: <hi>which is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly falſe, as the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>themſelues muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; or elſe grant, that it is not neceſſary to beleeue the King to be Supreame-head of the Church: or that the Church is to be gouerned by Biſhops: or that we are iuſtified by Christs iuſtice imputed to vs: or that there be but two Sacraments: or that the Church ſeruice muſt be ſaid in the vulgar tongue: or that all things neceſſary to be beleeued to ſaluation, are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures. To be ſhort, not one article of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is contrary to ours) is conteined in this Creede, of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:643:104"/>the Apostles: therefore to affirme as he doth, all neceſſary points of religion to be contained in this Creede, is to caſt their owne religion flat to the ground: and to teach, that not one point of it is to be beleeued: this Creede may neuertheleſſe be called the</hi> key <hi>and</hi> rule <hi>of</hi> faith, <hi>becauſe it containeth the principall points of the Christian religion, and doth open (as it were) the doore vnto all the rest, and guide a man certainely vnto the knowledge of them, by teaching vs to beleeue the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church, which being</hi> the pillar and ground of truth,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15. Ioh. 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>directed and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by the ſpirit of truth, <hi>will alwaies inſtruct her obedient children, in all truth neceſſary to ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then, ſaith</hi> M. PERKINS: The eternall truth of God, the Creatour, ſhall depend on the determination of the creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nothing leſſe: for Gods truth is moſt ſincere and certaine in it ſelfe, before any declaration of the church: but we poore creatures that are ſubiect to miſtaking and error, ſhould not ſo certainely vnderſtand and know that truth of God, vnleſſe hee had ordained and appointed ſuch a skilfull and faithfull Miſtris and interpreter, to aſſure vs, both what is his word, and what is the true meaning of it. Like as pure gold is not made perfect in it ſelf by the Gold-ſmithes touch-ſtone; but other men are thereby aſſured, that it is true and pure gold: euen ſo the word of God doth not borrow his truth from the Church; but the true children of God are by the holy Church aſſured, which is the ſame his word. If we did hold (as we do not) that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word containeth all points of doctrine neceſſary to ſaluation: yet were it moſt neceſſary to relie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the</hi> Catholike churches <hi>declaration, both to be aſſured which books of ſcriptures be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, which not; (whereupon</hi> Saint Auguſtine <hi>(a man of far better iudgement than any of theſe daies) ſaid,</hi>

               <p>How M. Pirkins vnderſtood that <hi>all neceſſary points in religion to be beleeued are contained in the Creede,</hi> I doe not well conceiue: for my part I rather admit, that the Creed is therefore called <hi>the key and rule of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Creed how the key and rule of faith.</note> for that it is a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Briefe, containing the principall and fundamentall points of Chriſtian faith, which doe as it weere open the doore to all the reſt, and by which all preaching and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith is to be eſteemed, ſo as nothing may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but what holdeth correſpondence with this rule, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe vſes which the Scripture teacheth vs to make of euery part therof. Which the ſcripture, I ſay, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to make; for if we draw any article of our faith to the maintenance of any doctrine which hath no warrant or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Scripture, we are corrupters of the faith, and doe but abuſe the name thereof to the cloaking of our owne deuice. Thus M. Biſhop and his fellowes corrupt the faith as touching <hi>the holy catholike church,</hi> firſt in wreſting the name of <hi>the catholike church</hi> to the particular church of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:643:105"/>Rome: and ſecondly, in challenging a certain and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted credit to be yeelded to that church for the infallible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all points of faith. For as touching the firſt, where hath the Scripture giuen vs any inckling, that the name of the Catholike Church ſhould in any peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be vnderſtood of the Church of Rome? We regard not their claime; we know they haue tongue at will to ſpeake for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; but let them giue vs one word of God, whereby it may appeare that by the name of the Church, we are directed in ſpecial maner to that church. We are not ignorant that amongſt moſt ancient writers the name of <hi>Catholike church</hi> is ſometimes giuen to the church of Rome: but we know withall, that it was no otherwiſe giuen to the church of Rome, than to any other church, euery Church being called <hi>a Catholike church,</hi> as hath been

                  <hi>the name of the catholike church, and thoſe things which the Prophets haue foreſpoken of the church of Chriſt, can agree to no other but to the church of Rome.</hi> And with this madde and witleſſe fancy they are all caried away, ſo that there can bee no naming of the church or catholike church, but it ſoundeth in their eares vndoubtedly to haue refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Church of Rome. According to this fancy it is that M. Biſhop heere would haue his Reader to imagine, that by the beleefe of the Catholik church he is taught to beleeue the church of Rome. And by the ſame illuſion hee wreſteth to his purpoſe the words of the Apoſtle, that <hi>the church is the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and the promiſe that Chriſt maketh vnto his, of his <hi>ſpirit to direct and guide them into all truth,</hi> as if therein were ſome ſpeciall priuiledge meant to the Roman church.
<note place="margin">The Church how the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar &amp; ground of truth.</note> But for the firſt place, if any one church might challenge a prerogatiue therby, it ſhould be the church of Epheſus. For Timothie was Biſhop of Epheſus, wiſhed by the Apoſtle
<note n="l" place="margin">1. Tim. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>to abide ſtill there,</hi> as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to take vpon him the charge of that place. He writeth to him purpoſely to inſtruct him how to carry himſelfe in that charge;

                  <hi>That thou maist know,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>how thou oughteſt to behaue thy ſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the church of the liuing God, the pillar &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truth. The houſe of God</hi> then, wherin Timothie was to conuerſe, &amp; which he was to gouern, was the church of Epheſus; &amp; as the church in general, ſo this church for it own part in particular is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the church of the liuing God, the pillar and ground of truth. Yea</hi> theſe two goe hand in hand, <hi>to be the houſe of God, the church of the liuing God,</hi> and, <hi>to be the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> Now of euery church of the faithfull it is ſaid,
<note n="n" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee as liuely ſtones are made a ſpirituall houſe;

<note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 2.22.</note> yee are built together in Christ to be Gods habitation.</hi> Which way then, I maruell, is it now brought about, that to be <hi>the pillar &amp; ground of truth</hi> ſhould be a peculiar dignity of the church of Rome more than of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:643:106"/>the church of Epheſus, or of any other particular church? To be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth</hi> importeth the office and duty of the whole church and euery part thereof, and not a ſpeciall prerogatiue of any one church, as to bee alwaies found ſo in act and execution. The church is the pillar and ground of truth, as the Prieſt <hi>is
<note n="q" place="margin">Mal. 2.7.</note> the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> The Prieſt, though he be by calling <hi>the meſſenger of the Lord,</hi> yet ſometimes neglecteth his calling, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to doe the meſſage wherewith hee is ſent: and ſo the church, though by duty it be <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> appointed to vphold and maintaine the ſame; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forgetteth this duery and followeth lies in ſtead of truth. For as the church is now, ſo hath it euer beene from the beginning, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth;</hi> and yet we finde that very often the church of the Iewes, in the time of the Iudges, and vnder the wicked Kings of Iudah and Iſrael, did forſake
<note n="t" place="margin">Mal. 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>the law of truth,</hi> which God had giuen vnto them, went a whooring after ſtrange and falſe gods, and many waies prouoked him by their abominations. For no longer doth the church continue to be as it ought to be, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> than it continueth built vpon the foundations of truth,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Eph. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>vpon the foundations of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> as Saint Paul ſpeaketh,

                  <hi>that is, vpon the new and old Teſtament,</hi> as Ambroſe expoundeth it. If it once go awry from thoſe foundations, truth falleth to the ground, and it becommeth a pillar and fortreſſe of errour and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. Thus hath it come to paſſe in M.

                  <hi>the ſpirit of truth from

But M. Biſhop not content with one corruption, in ſubſtituting his church of Rome in the place of the Catholike Church of Chriſt, addeth another, in ſaying, that that article of our Creede doth teach vs <hi>to beleeue the Catholike church.</hi> Which words, although being truely meant, they expreſſe the ſame in Engliſh, which wee ſay in Greeke and Latin, yet being by the drift of his ſpeech caried to a verie partiall and falſe conſtruction, doe ſhew him to be a leaud peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Chriſtian faith. For whereas we ſaie, <hi>Credo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam eccleſiam Catholicam,</hi> in the accuſatiue caſe, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, <hi>I beleeue that there is a holy Catholike church;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God the Father in all ages and at all times, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the defections and corruptions of the world hath ſtill had and ſhall haue his number of elect and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom the benefite of Chriſts death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

But M. Biſhop by the currant of his ſpeech turneth the accuſatiue caſe into the datiue, as if it were ſaid in our Creed, <hi>Credo eccleſiae ſanctae Catholicae; I giue credit to the holy Catholike church; I beleeue it to be true whatſoeuer is taught me by the holy Catholike church,</hi> that ſo his Reader thinkeing himſelfe bound to beleeue the Catholike church, and taking this Catholike church to be meant of the church of Rome, may hold himſelfe bound by the articles of his Creed in all things to beleeue the church of Rome. Thus he and his fellowes moſt treacherouſly and leaudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne knowledge and conſcience delude ſimple and ignorant ſoules, and make them ſlaues to their impious and wicked deuices, by bearing them in hand that they are bound thus to obey the Catholike church. Now heereof Maſter PERKINS iuſtly inferreth, that <hi>the eternall truth of God the Creatour is heereby made to depend vpon the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the creature.</hi> For let God ſay what he will, wee ſhall not ſtand bound to take it for truth if the church ſhall ſay the contrary, or vnleſſe that which he ſaith be approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church. Verily as Tertullian vpbraided of old the Senate of Rome, that

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:643:109"/>vs that <hi>Gods truth is ſincere and certaine in it ſelfe before any declaration of the Church.</hi> Well, and what hath the church then to doe with this ſincere and certaine truth? Forſooth, <hi>we poore creatures are ſubiect to miſtaking and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and doe not ſo certainly vnderſtand that truth of God.</hi> But who are thoſe <hi>poore creatures,</hi> of whom he ſpeaketh? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry M. Biſhop, and ſuch other petites, who are but <hi>dij mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum gentium,</hi> they are <hi>poore creatures;</hi> but the Pope and his Cardinals, and the Biſhops that comply to him, they are <hi>rich creatures,</hi> they are the Church, they are exempted from miſtaking and errour; we muſt thinke all perfection of wit to be lodged in their braines; and that they certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand and know the truth of God. But what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can they giue vs in this behalfe? Surely, the Scribes and Phariſees, the high Prieſts and Elders of the lewes had as much to ſay for themſelues, and a great deale more than they. They could plead for themſelues:
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 8.33.</note> 
                  <hi>We are the ſeede of Abraham;
<note n="t" place="margin">cap. 9.28.</note> We be Moſes diſciples;
<note n="u" place="margin">verſ. 41.</note> We ſee;
<note n="x" place="margin">Ier. 8 8.</note> We are wiſe, and the law of the Lord is with vs;
<note n="y" place="margin">ca. 18.18.</note> The law ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from the Prieſt, nor counſell from the wiſe, nor the word from the Prophet;</hi> and yet they perſecuted Chriſt the ſonne of God, who only is the Truth. How then may we now be aſſured that the Church of Rome is not the ſame to the church of Chriſt, as they then were to Chriſt himſelfe? How may we <hi>poore creatures</hi> certainely vnderſtand, that thoſe <hi>rich creatures</hi> are not ſubiect to error and miſtaking as well as we? Well, if we will not beleeue it, we may chuſe; but aſſurance M. Biſhop can yeeld none. He can tell vs a diſcourſe what Chriſt ſaid to Peter: but that Chriſt euer ſpake either of Pope or Cardinall, he can ſhew vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And yet as if this matter were cleere, he telleth vs of this church of theirs, that whereas we are ſubiect to miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and errour, <hi>God hath ordained and appointed the ſame to be a skilfull and faithfull miſtreſſe and interpreter, to aſſure vs both what is his word, and what is the true meaning of it.</hi> But againe we aske him, where hath God ſo ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed?
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:643:109"/>in what Scripture hath he written it, or by what words hath he expreſſed it, that the church which he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhould bee our miſtreſſe to tell vs what is Gods word, &amp; what is the true meaning of it? If he haue euidence &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it, let him ſhew it; if he haue not, what ſhall we thinke of him that dareth thus to bely the maieſty of God? But if he conſidered the matter aright, he would conceiue, that thoſe <hi>rich creatures</hi> of his, haue no other or better meanes to aſſure <hi>what is Gods word, and what is the meaning of it,</hi> than other <hi>poore creatures</hi> haue. By what <hi>touchſtone</hi> they can make triall thereof, by the ſame can we alſo as well as they. Which compariſon of <hi>the gold-ſmith</hi> and <hi>the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> which he himſelfe vſeth, if it be rightly explicated, ſerueth notably to ſet foorth the fraud and falſhood of that church, for which he pleadeth. True it is, that the church in this behalfe may rightly bee compared to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith. Now the Gold-ſmith for the diſcerning of true and perfect gold, doth not take his owne fingers ends, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the touch-ſtone, and no otherwiſe can hee either make triall himſelfe, or giue aſſurance thereof to other men. In like ſort therefore the church, which is the Gold-ſmith, muſt vſe a touch-ſtone, for the aſſuring of that which it propoundeth to bee receiued and beleeued. Now then whereas M. Biſhop ſaith, that <hi>we muſt rely vpon the churches declaration, to be aſſured which bookes of Scripture be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi> I anſwer him, that we cannot be aſſured thereof by the churches declaration, vnleſſe the church declare it and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it by the touch-ſtone. The touch-ſtone whereby we are to take aſſurance heereof, is the conſtant and perpetuall tradition and teſtimony of the former church.

What bookes then haue had this generall and vndoubted auerment and witneſſe of the church continued from time to time, thoſe and no other are to be holden for Canonicall bookes, and this is the true touch-ſtone for trial of certaine and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſcriptures. By which touchſtone the church of Rome is found to bee not <hi>a faithfull Miſtreſſe</hi> but a falſe harlot bringing her baſtards into the Church, and forcing men to take them for lawfully begotten. And whereas it is the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and declaration of the former church which hath beene from the beginning, by which both they and we are to be inſtructed as touching the true bookes of Canonicall Scripture, they force vpon vs the tradition of their owne church now deliuered vpon their owne word, howſoeuer contrary to that which the church formerly hath declared. If we follow the declaration of the ancient church, then are no other bookes to be taken for Canonicall, but what are now accknowledged and approoued in our Church, the ſame onely being teſtified concerning the old teſtament by the Church of the Iewes, concerning both new and old by the whole Chriſtian church, both the Greeke and Latine, the Eaſterne and Weſterne churches, as
<note n="e" place="margin">Of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſect. 17.</note> before hath been declared. But the church of Rome, perceiuing the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſome other writings to be likely to gaine credit to ſome broken wares whence her thrift and gaine ariſeth, hath taken vpon her very preſumptuouſly, as a Miſtreſſe or rather a goddeſſe, to giue diuine authority to thoſe bookes, reiecting the teſtimony of that church, which in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe ſhould bee miſtreſſe both to her and vs. In a word, whatſoeuer is to be attributed to the church in this reſpect,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:643:110"/>it is idlely by M. Biſhop referred to the church of Rome, as if all other churches muſt rely vpon her declaration, we our ſelues being able by the touchſtone to make triall of true Scriptures, as well as the church of Rome, and therefore there being no cauſe why we ſhould rely vpon them more than they vpon vs. And as vainely doth he apply to his purpoſe the ſaying of Saint Auſtin, that <hi>he ſhould not beleeue the Goſpell except the authority of the church mooued him thereunto;</hi> there being nothing therein meant but what may bee applied to the church England as well as to the church of Rome; Saint Auſtin ſpeaking generally of the vniuerſall church thorowout the world, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeciall intendment of the church of Rome. But how leudly they abuſe thoſe words of Auſtin wholly againſt his meaning and purpoſe, I haue
<note n="f" place="margin">Of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſect. 22.</note> before ſufficiently declared and neede not heere to repeat againe. As for <hi>the churches declaration for vnderſtanding the Scripture,</hi> that is alſo to be tried and made good by the touchſtone, becauſe no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or ſenſe of Scripture is to be admitted, the doctrine whereof is not to be iuſtified by other Scripture; and they that bring other ſenſes and meanings do <hi>but deceiue men and leade them into errour,</hi> as other heretikes formerly haue done, and as the Papiſts now doe, abuſing the Scriptures to <hi>draw others after them into deſtruction.</hi> Heereof alſo enough hath beene ſaid
<note n="g" place="margin">Of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſect. 21.</note> before, whereof I wiſh the Reader duely to conſider for his ſatisfaction in this point. That which he ſaith of other ancient Creeds and Confeſſions of faith, that they containe not all points of Chriſtian doctrine, I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily admit: but yet let him vnderſtand, that it is a maine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice againſt them, that neither any ancient Creed, nor any expoſition of the Creed, or confeſſion of faith conteineth ſundry pointes, which they now make to be matters of the meaning of the Creede. Let him ſhew that euer any ancient Creed or expoſitour of the Creed did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or deliuer, that the name of the Catholike church in the Creed hath any ſpeciall reference to the Church of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:643:111"/>Rome; that the Catholike church is to be defined as they now define it, by being ſubiect to the biſhop of Rome; that the certaine declaration of the Canonicall bookes, and of the true ſenſe of Scripture, is alwaies infallibly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the ſentence of that Church; that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are fully to beleeue and wholly to relie vpon that Church for reſolution of all points of faith neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Which, and ſuch other points, made by them mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Creed, becauſe neuer any ancient writer hath found to be conteined or intended in the Creed, therefore we iuſtly affirme them to be new Creed-makers, coiners of new articles of faith, and thereby peruerters and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the true Chriſtian faith. As concerning the Articles mentioned by M. Perkins now holden by the Romiſh Church, <hi>that the Pope is Chriſts Vicar and head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church; that there is a purgatorie fire after this life, that images of God and of Saints are to be worſhipped; that praier is to be made to Saints departed, and their interceſſion to bee required; that there is a propitiatorie ſacrifice daily offered in the Maſſe for the ſinnes of quicke and dead;</hi> M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop anſwereth, that <hi>the Fathers haue most plainly taught them in their writings, and expreſly condemned of hereſie most of the contrary poſitions.</hi> But what Fathers are they, and in what writings haue they ſo done? Surely, if the Biſhop of Rome in the ancient Church had beene taken to bee the Vicar of Chriſt, and head of the Catholike church, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that we ſhould haue very currant and frequent and memorable teſtimonie thereof, as a matter vniuerſally receiued, and euery where practiſed. But now let M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhew vs one; let him ſhew ſo much as one that for diuers hundreds of yeeres after Chriſt, did euer dreame of any ſuch thing. Which though indeed he cannot doe, yet hee telleth vs of that and the reſt, that <hi>in thoſe ſeuerall queſtions he hath before prooued</hi> what he ſaith; whereas hee hath not ſpoken of any more of theſe points, ſaue onely one, and in that one point, cannot be ſaid to haue prooued
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:643:111"/>any thing, becauſe whatſoeuer hee hath ſaid, ſtandeth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto reprooued. And ſurely if he haue no better proofes than hitherto he hath brought in all the queſtions that hee hath handled, the Proteſtants will but ſcorne him as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnproouing diſputer, and aduiſe him to beſtow his time a while longer in the Schooles, to know what it is to prooue.</p>

                  <hi>when wee ſay wee beleeue in God the Father, in the Sonne, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, this phraſe of ſpeaking doth ſignifie that wee ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue God the Father, the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt, as that alſo we place all our confidence in them, which we are to put in God onely, and not increatures, of which notwithſtanding the Church conſisteth.</hi> Which expoſition wee acknowledge conteineth the very trueth, agreeable to Gods word, and doe wiſh that they would alwaies continue conſtant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But they doe heerein as their vſuall maner is, what by euidence of truth they are forced to ſay in one place, for the maintenance of their owne traditions and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they vnſay it or qualifie it in another. And in this ſort M. Biſhop heere dealeth, who firſt inclining ſomewhat to that conſtruction alreadie mentioned, and telling vs that <hi>to beleeue in a thing, is to make it our Creatour, by giuing our whole heart vnto it,</hi> alleageth notwithſtanding, that <hi>ſome ancient Doctours take the words (to beleeue in) not ſo preciſely, but ſay that wee may beleeue in the church and in Saints;</hi> heereby to make way to his abſurd conceits, which none of the ancient Doctours dreamed of. it is true indeed that Epiphanius and Cyril haue vſed that maner of ſpeech, by adding the prepoſition, <hi>in,</hi> to the reſt of the articles; <hi>I beleeue in one holy Catholike church, in one Baptiſme, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, in the reſurrection of the body, in the life eternal;</hi> but yet making thereof no other conſtruction than we do, as if the article were away. <hi>To beleeue in the church,</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:643:112"/>was with them, as M. Biſhop ſaith, to <hi>beleeue certainly in the Catholike church, to be the onely true company of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and thereof we contend not; wee beleeue the ſame as well as they, though not in M. Biſhops meaning, which neuer was any part of their meaning, that <hi>the Catholike church</hi> ſhould be meant in any ſpeciall maner of the church of Rome. But whereas he addeth, it is another part of their conſtruction, that to <hi>the lawfull gouernours thereof,</hi> that is, as he intendeth, to the Pope and his Cardinals and Biſhops, it <hi>appertaineth to declare both which bookes be Canonicall, and what is the true meaning of all doubtfull places in them;</hi> he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhamefully abuſeth the ancient Doctours, of whom there is not one that hath noted any ſuch matter to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the Creed. If hee know any, let him acquaint vs therewith; if hee know none, let him confeſſe to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as he muſt, that he hath ſought to deceiue him with a lie. The ſame I ſay of <hi>beleeuing in Saints;</hi> for which of the ancient Doctours hath taught vs out of our Creed, that we are to beleeue in them? He telleth vs what they meant by it, that <hi>wee beleeue the Saints in heauen to heare our praiers, to be carefull to pray for vs, and to be able to obteine by intreatie much at Gods hands.</hi> But what a ſtrange man is he that will tell vs what men meant by words which they neuer ſpake?

                  <hi>He chargeth vs firſt,</hi> with the breach of the third article, <hi>Conceiued by the holy Ghost:</hi> Which <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is ouerturned by the tranſubſtantiation of bread and wine in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> into the body and blood of Chriſt: for heere wee are taught to confeſſe the true and perpetuall incarnation of Chriſt, beginning in his conception, and neuer ending af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Heere is a ſtrange expoſition of the Creed. Is Christs incarnation perpetuall, and not yet ended? then it is true to ſay, that Christ is not yet incarnate; as we may ſay truely, that a man is not borne, vntill his birth be accompliſhed and ended. But to the preſent purpoſe: becauſe Christs incarnation began at his conception, cannot bread be turned afterward into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? how hangeth this together? Belike he meanes</hi> that Chriſts body was but once conceiued, and that was by the holy Ghoſt in his mothers wombe: <hi>therefore it cannot afterward be made of any other thing. This to be his meaning, he declares in the queſtion of the Sacrament; but it is too too ſimple and childiſh. For we hold him not to be ſo conceiued by bread, as he was by the holy Ghost, who was the efficient cauſe of his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but that the ſame body that was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, is made really preſent in the Sacrament, by tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:643:114"/>of bread into it, which hath no oppoſition at all with this article, as I haue more largely prooued in the for ſaid queſtion. And whereas he ſaith farther, cleane beſides the purpoſe of this article,</hi> that Chriſts body hath the eſſentiall properties of a true body, ſtanding of fleſh and bone: <hi>we grant the ſame; but when he addeth,</hi> that locall circumſcription cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from a body, <hi>he is deceiued: for the greatest body of all others, (which is the highest heauen) is not circumſcribed by any place; becauſe there is no other body without it, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities might compaſſe in, and circumſcribe that body of the highest heauen. And when he ſaith,</hi> that to be circumſcribed in place, is an eſſential property of euery quantity; and that quantity is the common eſſence of euery body: <hi>he makes himſelfe but a common mocking-ſtocke vnto euery ſimple Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who knoweth that no accident</hi> (<hi>ſuch as euery</hi> quantity <hi>is</hi>) <hi>can be of the eſſence and nature of a</hi> ſubſtance, <hi>ſuch as Christs body is. Neither would any man ſay, (that cared what he ſaid) that to be circumſcribed in a place is eſſential to euery quantity, when all</hi> numbers <hi>that be quantities, haue no relation vnto any place: neither is it of the eſſence of any quantity to be actually circumſcribed by a place; but it is a property flowing out of the eſſence of one only kinde of quantitie,</hi> to be apt, and fit to be circumſcribed <hi>and compaſſed about with a place. And natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all bodies (except the highest heauen) haue one place, out of which they paſſe</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Saint Auſtin <hi>ſaid</hi>) <hi>when they come into another: but by the omnipotent power of God, any body may be ſeparated from his place, or be in as many places at once, as it ſhall pleaſe God to ſeate it: becauſe to be circumſcribed with a place actually, is a meere accident vnto a ſubstantiall body, and without the nature of quantity; and God may not without blaſphemy be diſabled to ſeparate a ſubſtance from an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>

Now it is true, that becauſe Chriſt hath but one only body, and that body was perfect by that incarnation, therefore bread, which hath his being after, cannot be ſaid to be turned into the body which was before. For when one thing is turned into another, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not, till it be produced of the former, neither hath the one beginning, but by the ending of the other. Aarons rod was turned into a ſerpent, but the ſerpent was not till of the rod there became a ſerpent. Our Sauiour Chriſt turned water into wine, but the wine was not till of water there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wine. And abſurd it is, that one and the ſame thing being fully and perfectly made already, ſhould yet be ſaid <hi>to be made of any other thing.</hi> As for M. Biſhops exception, it is childiſh and impertinent, becauſe we doe not charge them to hold, that <hi>the body of Chriſt is ſo conceiued by bread as it was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, who was the efficient cauſe of his conception:</hi> but we ſay, that ſith the body of Chriſt by the power of the holy Ghoſt was conceiued and made of the ſubſtance of the Virgin Mary, and thereby became a conſummate and perfect body, it is therefore abſurd to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the ſame body is now to be made of any other thing.

                  </gap> the truth of his body. M. Biſhop anſwereth, that M. PER. <hi>heerein is deceiued; For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the greatest body of all other, which is the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is not circumſcribed by any place, becauſe there is no body without it to circumſcribe it.</hi> Well, but yet it hath dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:643:115"/>and poſition and diſtance of parts, and motion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and therefore <hi>quantum inſe,</hi> it is locally circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; the only defect is, that it hath not a body without it to be circumſcribed thereby. Yea we may truely ſay, that it hath a kinde of locall circumſcription by the ſuperficiall clauſure and determination of it owne ſubſtance. In aſ much therefore as in it ſelfe it hath euery way the condition of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call circumſcription, it is no inſtance againſt M. PER. rule, that locall circumſcription cannot be ſeuered from a true body. But becauſe he taketh <hi>locall circumſcription</hi> ſo nicely as we ſee he doth, I would gladly haue him to reſolue vs one queſtion thereof, and his anſwer ſhall ſhew the nullity of his owne exception. He hath told vs
<note n="a" place="margin">Preface to the Reader, ſect. 2.</note> before that <hi>the body of Chriſt is in one place circumſcribed, and in another vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſcribed:</hi> circumſcribed in heauen, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vncircumſcribed. Now let him tell vs how the body of Chriſt in heauen hath <hi>locall circumſcription?</hi> To ſpeake of Phyſicall and material heauens, it is true of Chriſt which the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note n="b" place="margin">Ephe. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>He is aſcended far aboue all heauens,</hi> and therefore aboue that <hi>higheſt heauen,</hi> which M.

How then is the body of Chriſt <hi>locally circumſcribed,</hi> where yet there is no Phyſicall or naturall place? Let him giue vs anſwer heereof, and then we will anſwer him, that looke what giueth <hi>locall circumſcription</hi> to the body of Chriſt in heauen, the ſame alſo giueth <hi>locall circumſcription</hi> to the higheſt heauen. Vnderſtand <hi>the highest heauen,</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader, as M. Biſhop doth, for the vttermoſt ſphere of the materiall globe of this viſible world, beyond which is that heauen into which we beleeue our Lord Ieſus to haue aſcended, and where we hope to dwell with him. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception being fruſtrate, let vs ſee the reſt, where M. Biſhop ſtanding nicely and preciſely vpon termes of ſchooles, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that M. PERKINS <hi>makes himſelfe a common mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtocke
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:643:115"/>to euery ſimple Logician,</hi> of whom notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I dare boldly ſay, that hee was as good a Logician as Doctour Biſhop is, though writing to the people he vſed his words accordingly. He ſaith that <hi>quantity is the common eſſence of euery body,</hi> and who knoweth not, ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>that no accident, as euery quantity is, can be of the eſſence of a ſubſtance as Chriſts body is.</hi> Well Sir, but yet quantity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth exiſtence to euery body, which is enough to M. PER. purpoſe, and <hi>to be the ſubiect of quantity, or indued with quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> is the common and true eſſence of <hi>a body.</hi> If he will ſay, nay; we deſire him of his courteſie to take the paines to ſend vs without quantity the true definition of <hi>a body.</hi> Albeit his reading might ſerue him to vnderſtand, that there are few learned men, or none at all, ſo ſtrict in termes, but that they call by the name of <hi>eſſentiall properties</hi> whatſoeuer doth immediately and neceſſarily iſſue from the eſſence of a thing, though according to Logicke rules it be no part of the eſſence thereof. And thus M. PERK. ſaith againe, that <hi>to be circumſcribed in place is an eſſentiall property of euery quantity:</hi> which ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>no man would ſay that cared what hee ſaid.</hi> And why? Becauſe <hi>all numbers,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>which be quantities, haue no relation vnto any place.</hi> But hee might eaſily haue conceiued that M. PER. as I ſaid before, ſpake according to vulgar vſe, which for the moſt part vnderſtandeth quantity of the magnitude and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bodies, in which meaning it is a property flowing out of the eſſence of euery quantity, not onely to be apt to be circumſcribed with a place, but to be circumſcribed and determined locally according to that meaning of <hi>locall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcription</hi> which I haue before expreſſed. Therefore in this ſort it is not a <hi>meere accident to a ſubstantiall body to be circumſcribed,</hi> but it is <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> agreeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to euery body, and to nothing but a body, neceſſarily ariſing of the dimenſions of the length, breadth and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a body, and the deniall whereof is the taking away of the nature of a body. As for his allegation of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:643:116"/>power of God how idle it is, it hath beene
<note n="c" place="margin">Preface to the Reader. ſect. 8.</note> before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. For God doth not by his omnipotency contradict himſelfe, neither doth his power ſerue to make good the fantaſticall dreames of giddy headed men to be ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the nature of a thing, and yet to leaue it ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſelfe-ſame thing. But it is woorth the noting how M. Biſhop heere plaieth the micher and ſtealeth by two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations vſed by M. Perkins, very pertinent to the matter heere in hand. It is for the illocality of the body of Chriſt that M. Biſhop pleadeth the omnipotency of God: but M. Perkins bringeth in Leo Biſhop of Rome, ſaying that

                  <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> In this ſort doe we in the articles of our Creede profeſſe to beleeue the holy Catholike church. That there is a church alſo viſible no man denieth, no man doubteth: nay we affirme, that it is amidſt that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:643:118"/>church which wee ſee that God gathereth vnto himſelfe that church which we cannot ſee. And to ſpeake of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church alſo, we cannot ſee it to be Gods church, or that it is Gods word that there is preached, or that they are the Sacraments of Chriſt which are there adminiſtred, or that there is any fruit or benefite to be reaped thereby. We ſee theſe things done, but the eſtimation of them is a matter of faith and not of fight: we ſee the perſons, but we do not by our eies perceiue them to be that that they take vpon them to be. But being by faith inſtructed that theſe things are of God, or profeſſing ſo to be beleeue, we diſcerue by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſeeing who they are to whom we are to adioine our ſelues for the exerciſe of our faith. So then the church is both viſible and inuiſible: viſible as touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, viſible as touching open aſſemblies and exerciſes; but not viſible to bee the church of God: for then Iewes and heathens would ſee ſo much, and would leaue to perſecute, which now they doe not, becauſe they haue no faith, and the church is no otherwiſe knowen ſo to be, but onely by faith. Now what ſaith M. Biſhop to hurt any thing that we ſay? <hi>The perſons,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Catholike church are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but their indowments are inuiſible.</hi> Well, and men are not true members of the true church by being ſuch and ſuch perſons: but by hauing ſuch and ſuch inward indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and therfore though they bee viſible as touching their perſons, yet they are not viſible as true members of the church. The church therefore which wee profeſſe to beleeue, which conſiſteth in them that are the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible church, muſt needs be granted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible. Yea I ſay further, that men are not at all members of the viſible church by being ſuch and ſuch perſons, but by profeſſion of the faith and name of Chriſt and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sacraments. And therfore M. Biſhop doth much amiſſe to compare viſible perſons and inward qualities with the body &amp; the ſoule, becauſe to be a viſible perſon is not to be in part a member of the church, as the body is part
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:643:118"/>of a man, for then euery Turke and Infidell might be ſaid to be in part a member of the church, becauſe he is a man: but outward acceptance of the faith and viſible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the church, maketh a man outwardly a member thereof, and is as it were the body: the life and ſoule wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the inward grace of the ſpirit: whereby he is indeed to the eies of God, that which outwarly he ſeemeth to bee to the eies of men. But a further difference alſo there is, for that the ſoule though in it ſelfe it be inuiſible, yet is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiued and diſcerned by the actions and motions of the body, and therefore well may a man be ſaid to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a man, though as touching the ſoule it ſelfe he be inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; whereas there are no ſuch actions or motions of a member of the viſible church whereby the eie of man can certainely ſee that hee hath life within, or is ſpiritually the ſame to God, that outwardly he giueth ſemblance to men to be. Becauſe therefore the true members of the church are not to be diſcerned with the eie, it followeth that the church properly ſo called, conſiſting of thoſe true members is viſible to God onely.</p>

The Goſpell fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably commendeth vnto vs the keeping thereof as a fruit of faith; the law ſtrictly requireth it as the condition
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:643:120"/>of eternall life. The Goſpell admitteth forgiueneſſe of that that by humane frailty is left vndone: the law is neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnleſſe

Therefore if the beleefe of out obteining eternall life muſt reſt vpon our workes according to the law, we can neuer haue aſſurance of faith, becauſe we can neuer finde ſufficiency and contentment in our owne works. It followeth therefore, that to build the faith of the Goſpell vpon the workes of the Law, is to confound the Law and the Goſpell, and to deſtroy the truth of faith.
<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>If they which are of the law be heires,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>then faith is made voide, and the promiſe is made of none effect.</hi> But
<note n="i" place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore it is of faith, that it may be of grace</hi> (and therefore

Whereas he telleth vs, <hi>that he may haue a very good hope by Gods grace to performe them,</hi> his owne heart telleth him that he ſaith vntruely, becauſe he knoweth himſelfe debarred from that hope by God himſelfe, by whoſe words we are taught, that

                  <hi>conſiſteth rather in forgiueneſſe of ſinnes than in perfection of vertues.</hi> It remaineth therefore, that true faith is the apprehenſion and particular application of the promiſe of God, expecting the effect and participation thereof, not for any workes of ours, but for his owne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake. Of which faith it followeth indeed, that <hi>we turne from our ſinnes, and conforme our will to Gods will, and abide in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:643:120"/>the lap of the Catholike church,</hi> but theſe are effects and not cauſes of that ſtate of ſaluation which we attaine by faith onely. Saint Auſtin therefore requiring theſe things, doth not ſhake his owne aſſertion of particular faith, whereby he teacheth a man, as M. Perkins ſheweth, to beleeue as touching himſelfe, the remiſſion of ſinnes, the reſurrection of the body, and euerlaſting life. As for the contradiction which M. Biſhop noteth in M. PER. words, it is more in his conceit than it is indeed. He ſaith heere, that the act of faith is particularly to apply: he ſaith elſewhere, that faith notwithſtanding doth not alwaies attaine to a diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by formall propoſition, but that it is ſometimes inuolued and inlapped in ſighes and grones, in deſires and praiers to God, which cannot be without an expectance of Gods goodneſſe and mercy, and yet a perplexed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led minde by queſtioning it ſelfe cannot ſee ſo much in it ſelfe. He ſaith againe, that ſome define faith generally to be <hi>a certaine and full perſwaſion,</hi> which he calleth, <hi>ſo high a reach as few can attaine vnto,</hi> becauſe as there is ſtrong faith to perſwade certainely and fully, ſo there is alſo weake faith which apprehendeth and perſwadeth comfortably, but yet not with fulneſſe and vndoubted certainty. He ſaith nothing heere contrary to this, becauſe whether it be ſtrong faith to apply ſtrongly, or weake faith to apply weakely, yet both ſerue in their degree particularly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. It is then M. Biſhops want of vnderſtanding heere that maketh him to miſtake, not M. PER. heate of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling that maketh him to forget. But now to ſhew what Saint Auſtins opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is concerning theſe matters of beleefe, he bringeth vs two ſentences, the one to ſhew that by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faith a man cannot bee certaine of his ſaluation; the other, that a man once truely iuſtified may afterwards final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fal away; both tending to this, that a man cannot be ſaid by the articles of the Creed, to beleeue the remiſſion of his owne ſinnes vnto euerlaſting life. The firſt, as he alleageth, is thus:

                  <hi>I call it Apoſtolike, not making any great ſcruple who was the authour of it. Surely by the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ancient writers it is aſcribed to the Apoſtles, either for that they thought it in common written, and ſet foorth by them, or for that they thought good by ſuch a title to confirme this Briefe, which is faithfully gathered out of the doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by their hands. Neither doe I doubt whenceſoeuer it firſt began, but that from the firſt originall of the Chriſtian Church and from the very time of the Apoſtles it tooke place, as a publicke and generally approoued confeſſion. Neither is it likely to haue beene written in priuate by any one, becauſe it is certaine that from the very beginning it hath beene of ſacred authority amongst all godly men. That which we are entirely to regard, is without all controuerſie or doubt, that the whole ſtory of our faith is therein briefely and diſtinctly ſet downe, and nothing contained in it but what is confirmed by ſound teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture. Which vnderſtood and knowen, it is boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for a man either much to trouble himſelfe, or to contend with any other concerning the authour of it.</hi> Which words of Caluin conteining both his owne iudgement and ours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the authority of the Creed, doe ſufficiently refell
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:643:123"/>the malicious cauils of this vaine and abſurd wrangler. <hi>By our doctrine,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it is not neceſſary to beleeue the Creed,</hi> yea it <hi>is wholly to be reiected, becauſe it is no part of the written word.</hi> Indeed formally it is no part of the written word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a part of the very text of Scripture there ſet downe in that frame of words wherein we vſe it: but doe we any where ſay, that whatſoeuer is not ſo a part of the written word is wholly to be reiected, or not neceſſary to be beleeued? Nay we are ſo farre from ſaying or thinking ſo, as that we hold many things in M. Biſhops bookes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be beleeued, which notwithſtanding are ſo farre from being a part of the written word, as that for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold vaine cauillations and impudent falſehoods therein contained they deſerue rather to goe for wall paper, than to be read for learned bookes. As touching the matter and doctrine of the Creed, Caluin affirmeth that it is taken out of the doctrine of the Apoſtles, ſet downe in the written word, and therefore it is no more to be reiected than the word it ſelfe from whence it is taken. He denieth not but that the Apoſtles might be and were the authours of it, though he cannot certainly affirme that they were ſo. Hee acknowledgeth the conſent of ancient writers that it was compoſed by the Apoſtles. He confeſſeth the antiquity thereof euen from their very time. He holdeth it vnlikely to haue beene publiſhed by any priuate man, and therefore leaueth it moſt likely to be done by them. By whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was done, becauſe it is conſonant to the Apoſtolike ſpirit and doctrine, he acknowledgeth all ſacreed authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and opinion as heeretofore, ſo now to be attributed vnto it. What is there heere that malice it ſelfe could blame, but that Popiſh malice aboue other is blinde and cannot ſee it owne ſhame? Let vs now goe along with him to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and ſee what wiſe worke he maketh to prooue that which he ſaith, the <hi>Proteſtant Doctours doe foully mangle and in manner ouerturne the greateſt part of the Creed.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt article he ſaith, we erre many waies. But
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:643:123"/>how I pray you? firſt, ſaith he, <hi>they doe deſtroy the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnity of the Godhead, by teaching the diuine eſſence to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinguiſhed into three perſons.</hi> But how doth that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
<note place="margin">One eſſence of God diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed really into three perſons.</note> for if <hi>vnity of eſſence</hi> in this diſtinction bee <hi>terminus a quo;</hi> and <hi>triality of perſons,</hi> be <hi>terminus ad quem;</hi> and <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of diſtinction</hi> be vnderſtood not in the eſſence for it ſelfe but onely in the perſons, how ſhall it deſtroy the ſimple v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the God head, to ſay that one diuine eſſence is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed into three perſons. What, will M. Biſhop ſay that the diſtinction of the perſons is intellectuall only and not reall? Let him then ſet vp a ſchoole for Sabellius and Praxeas, the heretickes, and teach as they did, that

Biſhop aſhamed thus by aduantage of anothers words onely by him alleaged, and in the authours meaning vſed, ſo ill to requite him, and to charge him with that whereto he purpoſely defendeth the contrary in the ſame place? But why doe I ſpeake of ſhame; for what are thoſe men aſhamed of? And therfore he ſticketh not heere againe very groſly to belie Melancthon alſo, charging him to ſay, that <hi>there be as well three diuine natures as there be three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> whereas neither in the place by him quoted nor any otherwhere euer any ſuch matter proceeded from Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon. Vpon his ſecond point I will not ſtand, becauſe it is before handled in the ſixt ſection of the Preface. So is the third point handled there alſo in the eight ſection, and the fourth in the tenth, and that which he ſaith as touching the ſecond article, in the ſixt and ſeuen. His obiection as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third article is a very leaud and vnhoneſt ſlander. None of vs affirmeth that <hi>Christ was borne with the breach of his Mothers virginity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt borne without breach of his mothers vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.</note> becauſe her virginity ſtood in being free from the company of man, not in that ſhee had not her wombe opened when ſhe bare Chriſt.

Let him ſay what he will, but we will hold him for a ſorry fellow that concludeth breach of virginity of that opening of the wombe. As touching the fourth article, that Luther affirmed <hi>the Godhead it ſelfe to ſuffer,</hi> it is a lie.

That Chriſt according to his diuine nature alſo is our Mediatour, euen whole Chriſt both God and man, hath beene before iuſtified in anſwer to the ſeuenth ſection of his preface to the Reader. But to inferre, that therefore the Godhead it ſelfe ſuffereth, is as good a reaſon as to ſay, that becauſe the man dieth, therefore the ſoule is mortall. But ſaith M.

Would he take it patiently to heare another man to reaſon in this ſort? If he would not, why doth he himſelfe thus play the wiſeman, and mocke ſimple men that are not able to perceiue his fraude?

                  <hi>Behold I ſee the heauens open, and the Sonne of man ſlanding at the right hand of God.</hi> We wiſh him to remember, that in the meaſuring of matters of faith by rules of Philoſophy, Tertullian ſaith, that

                  <hi>Elias in a whirlewind aſcended into heauen.</hi> We beleeue that the heauens yeelded him way to goe thorow; and M. Biſhop will not ſay that he had as yet a glorified body to goe otherwiſe. What he will affirme otherwiſe,
<note place="margin">The ſoules of the faithfull in heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts incarnation.</note> let him prooue it, or elſe he ſhall not finde vs very haſty to beleeue it. Now that Elias aſcended into heauen, the text plainly affirmeth, as I haue alleaged, and therefore we beleeue vndoubtedly that he did ſo. The ſame Elias with Moſes,
<note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 9.31.</note> 
                  <hi>appeared vnto Chriſt in glory,</hi> and to his Diſciples, which glory they could not bring with them from the Popiſh <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> and therefore wee cannot doubt but they brought it with them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. We cannot doubt therefore, but that the ſoules of the faithfull that died before the incarnation of Chriſt were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into heauen. For as by the faith of Chriſts death and reſurrection, they were acquitted from hel, euen ſo doe we beleeue, that by the faith of Chriſts aſcenſion, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to heauen. And of faith the Apoſtle telleth vs, that
<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>it is the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, the demonſtration or euidence of things which are not ſeene,</hi> to which in effect and after a ſort, the things are, which yet indeed are not. By faith Abraham ſo long before

<note n="r" place="margin">Reuel. 13.8.</note> 
                  <hi>the lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world.</hi> To faith therefore Chriſt from the beginning of the world was aſcended into heauen, becauſe they ſo beleeued in him as if he were already aſcended. In effect then, Chriſt was the firſt that aſcended into heauen, becauſe no other aſcended, but by the faith of his aſcenſion. As for the places cited by M. Biſhop, they make nothing to the contrary, as which belong properly to the queſtion of the reſurrection of the dead, to ſignifie, that Chriſt is the firſt that
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>roſe from death, to die no more,</hi> and in whom all the reſt ſhal ſo riſe againe: but as touching the ſtate of the ſoules
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:643:131"/>departed, it prooueth nothing. As touching the being of Chriſt in heauen,
<note place="margin">Chriſt vntill his ſecond comming abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen onely.</note> we teach nothing but what hee himſelfe hath taught. If M. Biſhop will call it, <hi>a locking of him in heauen,</hi> it is not we that locke him, but he himſelfe hath locked himſelfe, who hath told vs, that
<note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 12 8.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhall not haue him alwaies with vs;</hi> that
<note n="u" place="margin">Acts 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>heauen must containe him vntill the time that all things bee fulfilled, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his Prophets ſince the world began;</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 10.12.13.</note> that <hi>he is at the right hand of God, hencefoorth expecting or waiting till his foes be made his footeſtoole.</hi> To affirme then, that Chriſt is in heauen only, and not vpon the earth; and that he ſo abideth vntill the time that he ſhall come againe to iudge the quicke and the dead, is not to locke vp Chriſt in heauen, but to iuſtifie the words of Chriſt. They may rather be ſaid <hi>to locke vp Chriſt,</hi> who of their owne heads, ſo tie him by the words of the Prieſt, as it were by a charme, to their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated hoaſt, as that

Of the meaning of Chriſts <hi>ſitting at the right hand of his father,</hi> I know no difference at all, but that all acknowledge it to import the exaltation of the humane nature of Chriſt to the communion and fellowſhip of the maieſty and glory of God, ſo as that all creatures both in heauen and earth are made ſubiect vnto him. He referreth vs to Conrad, ſome wizard or other; but if that which Conrad ſaith, be not woorth his reporting, we hold it not woorth our ſeeking, nor liſt to looke after euery foole which will ſucke fancies out of his fingers ends, and then make vs the authours of them. As for that which Caluin ſaith,
<note place="margin">How Chriſt ſhall continue or ceaſe to ſit at the right hand of God.</note> that after the laſt iudgement, Chriſt ſhall <hi>no longer ſit at the right hand of God,</hi> in that meaning wherein he ſpeaketh it, it is very true, not for that there ſhalbe abſolutely any end of his kingdome, which the Angell ſaith

But for the execution of this gouernement, he hath ſpecially exalted his ſonne, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt, in whoſe obedience and humbling of himſelfe, hee tooke that delight, as that as it were in hew thereof, he would ſet him vp, according to his humane nature,

Biſhop ſpecially intendeth. For if wee call that <hi>the true Church</hi> which truely hath the outward vocation and calling of the church, then we deny not but that the church, in the time of Antichriſt muſt bee and hath beene alwaies viſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, becauſe Antichriſt was to poſſeſſe and hath poſſeſſed the viſible ſtate of the church. But if by <hi>the true church,</hi> we meane thoſe members of the church which are truely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the vocation and calling of the church in faith and obedience vnto God, then the true church is not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:643:136"/>alwaies viſible, becauſe the greater part being the woorſe doth many times oppreſſe the better and weaker part, and proudly carrying it ſelfe in the opinion and confidence of it ſelfe, perſecuteth and driueth into corners all them that gaineſay their traditions and wilworſhips, which by their owne authority they eſtabliſh to delude thereby and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the word of God. And thus we ſay, that the true church, in the time of the exaltation of Antichriſt was in a ſort inuiſible, the publike ſtate of the church yeelding it ſelfe in thraldome to his tyranny, and perſecuting the true members of the church, who diſclaiming his obedience ſought to keepe themſelues entire, and faithfull vnto God. Whereas hee further addeth for the notation of the name <hi>Catholike,</hi> that the church was ſo called as <hi>being generally ſpred into all countries,</hi> we willingly acknowledge the ſame, as being before acknowledged by the ancient church, and defended againſt the Donatiſts, who by other expoſitions ſought to draw the name vnto themſelues, as the Papiſts now doe.

But if the Church preferre her owne will before the word of Chriſt, as the proud harlot of Rome doth, it ſhould be a wrong to Chriſt to beleeue the Church, and a way to ſet vp humane errour in ſtead of diuine truth. It is not the voice of the Church, but the word of the written Goſpell which God hath appointed, as Irenaeus euen now hath told vs, to be <hi>the foundation and pillar of our faith.</hi> For the words of the Church are many times the words of errour and vntruth; and therefore if we ſhould relie our ſaluation vpon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereof, wee ſhould indeed relie vpon an <hi>vncertaine ground and erring guide;</hi> but the word of the Goſpell is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies one and the ſame, without any variableneſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and therefore ſafely may wee relie our ſaluation thereupon.

Which though it ſeeme ſtrange to M.

                  <hi>according to the purpoſe of the grace of God.</hi> Now of this that wee ſay, that it is the holy Ghoſt which in baptiſme worketh the effect of grace, hee out of the abundance of his wit frameth another opinion, which with vs is no other but onely the explication of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As for his exception, that children haue not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of faith to lay hold on the grace of God which is offered in baptiſme, it auaileth nothing, becauſe children
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:643:139"/>are brought to baptiſme, though not in their owne faith, whereof they are vncapable; yet in the faith of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who apprehending the promiſe of God according to the tenour thereof, both for

Heere againe M. Biſhop imagineth a third opinion, whereas ſtill there is nothing ſaid but what is dependant vpon the firſt. And this third opinion he deliuereth according to his owne ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conceit thereof, and not according to that that by vs is intended.

<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.14. Children of faithfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents how vnderſtood holy.</note> 
                  <hi>the children of faithfull parents are holie.</hi> Hee betwixt his pride and ignorance, will take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Scripture ſo ſpeaketh, thereby to giue a true ſenſe and meaning of that it ſaith, but ſcornefully derideth it, and out of his owne diſtempered braines bringeth a fooliſh reaſon to diſpute againſt it. <hi>This is moſt phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and contrary to the Scriptures and daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And how ſo? Forſooth <hi>Iſaac was the ſonne of promiſe, and yet Eſau his ſonne was a reprobate, and many children of Chriſtians afterwards become Turkes: Therefore the children of the faithfull are not ſanctified in their mothers wombe.</hi> But did not his eies ſee that out of his owne doctrine a man might by the ſame argument ouerthrow the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of baptiſme alſo? for in like ſort a man may ſay; The children of many faithfull become reprobates and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; therefore the children of the faithfull are not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in baptiſme, which I ſuppoſe he will not admit. Surely he knoweth that by the doctrine of their ſchooles ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication once had may afterwards be loſt, and that many reprobates are for the time partakers thereof. It is then no argument to ſay, that becauſe many children of the faithfull are reprobates, therefore they were not ſanctified in their mothers wombe, becauſe, as hee will ſay of them,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:643:139"/>who are ſanctified in baptiſme; ſo it may be anſwered him of them who are ſanctified in their mothers wombe, that by apoſtaſie they forgoe that which by grace they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. I ſpeake not this to affirme that ſanctification which he imagineth, but onely to ſhew him the ſillineſſe of his argument whereby he impugneth it.

                  <hi>ſeeing it is certaine that the ſoules liue and are in peace, what maner of life or rest that is.

But yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is difference betwixt the ſleepe or rest of this life and of the life to come. For man in this life being wearied with the daies la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, at night entreth into his chamber as in peace, that there
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:643:143"/>he may ſleepe, and ſo in the night he enioyeth reſt, and knoweth nothing of any euill either of fire or of ſword. But the ſoule ſleepeth not ſo, but waketh and enioyeth the ſight, and heareth the ſpeeches of the Angels and of God. Therefore the ſleepe in the life to come is more profound than in this life, and yet the ſoule liueth in the preſence of God.</hi> Out of theſe laſt words M.

But what truth or conſcience may we thinke is in this man, who thus obiecteth the words as if Luther had put the ſoule in caſe of death, when notwithſtanding in the end of the ſame ſentence he addeth, that it <hi>liueth in the preſence of God,</hi> and in the whole circumſtance of the place, teſtifieth by the Scripture, that it enioieth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſight and ſpeech of God and his Angels, a moſt peacefull and bleſſed life, and that this <hi>ſleepe</hi> is not ſuch, but that the ſoule waketh alwaies.

                  <hi>when Luthers doctrine began to be knowen, and had gathered ſome ſtrength, theſe ghoſts and apparitions by little and little vaniſhed away. For Luther teacheth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>out of the holy Scriptures, that the ſoules of the dead are at reſt, and do wait for the laſt day of iudgement</hi> (meaning that where they are at reſt, there they abide vntill the day of iudgement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that wandring and walking which was commonly fancied of them) <hi>and that thoſe ſtirres and fearefull noiſes and ſighes were cauſed by Satan, who omitteth no occaſion to confirme in mens mindes vngodly deuotions and falſe opinions, and to extinguiſh the benefit of Chriſt our Sauiour.</hi> Now hee that waigheth theſe words, may eaſily ſee how M. Biſhop plaieth the Skoggin in the application of them, there being heere nothing at all directed againſt praier to Saints, and that that is intended againſt Purgatory, not being for that the ſoules are ſo ſoundly aſleepe, as he obiecteth, but for
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:643:144"/>that they are at reſt &amp; in peace with Chriſt if they belong to him, not ſubiect to any torments, nor hauing any cauſe of thoſe complaints which Satan cunningly pretended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their names. As for the complaint of Brentius, we doe not doubt but that he might finde cauſe of it in manie, who notwithſtanding did liue vnder the name of Chriſtians, of the profeſſours of the faith and Goſpel of Chriſt. The Prophets, the Apoſtles complained of ſuch, and yet the pearles then were not the woorſe eſteemed, for that ſwine trode them vnder their feete. The Pagans of old ſaw many taking vpon them to be Chriſtians, who yet were men of moſt wicked and damnable conuerſation, and they tooke occaſion hereby to condemne all Chriſtians and Chriſtian religion; and will M. Biſhop ſay that they did well in ſo doing?

                  <hi>where there is no law, there is no ſinne,</hi> and therefore the giuing of all his goods to the poore, was within the compaſſe of the law.

Thirdly, we make no Images to expreſſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, which is a ſpirit, and cannot be repreſented by lines and colours, but onely allow of ſome ſuch pictures, as ſet out ſome apparitions of God, recorded in the</hi> Bible; <hi>not doubting but that ſuch workes of God, may aſwell be expreſſed in colours to our eies, as they are by words to our eares and vnderſtanding.

His third excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>they make no Images to expreſſe the nature of God, but onely to ſet foorth ſome apparitions of God recorded in the Bible;</hi> how vaine it is, hath beene alſo fully declared in
<note n="c" place="margin">Of Images, ſect. 4. &amp; 7.</note> the handling of that queſtion. And very ſtrange it is that M. Biſhop ſhould make thoſe apparitions a colour for their idoll-images of God, when God himſelfe affirmeth that therefore hee did forbeare in the day when hee gaue the Law,
<note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 4.12.15</note> to appeere in any image or likeneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not haue them to make any image of him. Whereas he ſaith, that <hi>ſuch works of God may aſwell be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in colours to our eies, as they are by words to our eares and vnderſtanding,</hi> he ſhould vnderſtand that it is one thing to ſpeake of <hi>the works of God,</hi> another thing to ſpeake of <hi>the perſon of God.</hi> Wee queſtion not the expreſſing of the workes of God, but wee condemne the expreſſing of the perſon of God. And if the expreſſing of thoſe apparitions by words to our eares and vnderſtanding, be a reaſon why we may expreſſe the ſame by pictures to our eies, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindereth but that the nature of God alſo may bee expreſſed by colours and pictures to our eies, becauſe the ſame is by words according to our capacitie expreſſed to our eares and vnderſtanding. But God hath commanded himſelfe to be preached to the eare and vnderſtanding; he hath not commanded, nay hee hath forbidden himſelfe to be painted to the eie; and therefore the one is lawfull and godly, the other wicked and vnlawfull.

May we not thinke that you haue ſent vs a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſtinction, that giueth ſupernaturall vertue and qualitie to ſtocks and ſtones? But if ſupernaturall vertue &amp; qualitie doe yeeld a title of <hi>religious worſhip,</hi> how is it that

Well, hee will tell vs that the next time; in the meane while he giueth vs leaue to thinke their Romiſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites to be very naturally affected, that conceiue ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally of the deuiſers of ſuch blinde and witleſſe tales. As for that he ſaith, that <hi>they doe not binde God and his hearing of vs to certaine things and places, becauſe they hold that God may be worſhipped in all places,</hi> hee ſaith no more than Ieroboam hath in effect ſaid before for the ſetting vp of his idols; no more than the Pagans and Heathens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that their gods were in heauen; and therefore that in all places they might pray and ſacrifice vnto them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as they thought, that to pray before their Images, was a more ſpeciall and ſolemne deuotion, and they had there the heauenly powers more neerely preſent vnto them, ſo haue they beene affected in Poperie, and haue thought thoſe praiers to bee moſt effectuall which they haue made in the preſence of filthy idols, and to that end haue taken great paines to goe long iourneies and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages vnto them. But ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>the ſight of ſuch holy things doth breed more reuerence and deuotion in vs, and better keepe our mindes from wandering vpon vaine matters.</hi> He ſhould haue ſaid if hee would haue ſpoken as the truth is, that they breed ſuperſtition and errour, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and deuotion, that they cauſe God and his Saints to bee contemned in that ſtoliditie and blockiſhneſſe of dumbe idols, or at leaſtwiſe doe hold the minde ſo intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heere vpon the earth, as that it hath not power and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of affection to aſcend to heauen, as hath beene

               <p>Anſw. <hi>Firſt, heere is leaping from the Commandements to the Sacraments, which is out of order: ſecondly, I returne his argument vpon himſelfe.

Now what ill happe had Ieroboam, that he was not acquainted with theſe Romiſh ſchoole-trickes; for he might well haue anſwered both for himſelf and for the people, that though materially they erre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Calues, yet their intention was pure and holy, to worſhip the true God, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally they were true worſhippers.

M. Perkins ſeemeth to be of other minde, and hee followeth therein the iudgement of ſundry late Diuines; whom though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we greatly eſteeme and honour, yet wee cannot ſubſcribe that which they determine in this point. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parents belongeth to the honeſt and orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of marriage, and it is true that children ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fift Commandement, in neglecting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but this conſent is no part of the eſſence and being of marriage, which therefore being complet and perfect without it, muſt neceſſarily ſtand good, albeit the parents giue no conſent vnto it. The very eſſence of contract and marriage, conſiſteth in the parties actuall giuing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues mutually ech to other, according to the forme and maner of the countrey and place wherein they liue, which being done, the want of parents conſent cannot vndoe it, neither may they be ſundred in two, who by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though vnlawfully abuſed, are become one. By Gods ordinance, I ſay, becauſe albeit they haue not vſed that maner of proceeding which God hath ordeined to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:643:153"/>the faſtening of this bond, yet the bond it ſelfe wherewith they are faſtened, is the ordinance of God to remaine inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable betwixt them that are once bound thereby. Neither doth it make againſt this which is obiected, that <hi>God ioineth not ſuch together, that they marry not in the Lord;</hi> for ſo may it be ſaid of them that marry only for carnal &amp; worldly reſpects, of the beleeuer that matcheth him or her-ſelfe with an vnbeleeuer, that they are not ioined by God, nor married in the Lord, becauſe God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſuch kinde of marriages to be made. But yet as the bond of marriage though vnlawfully entred into holdeth theſe together, and may not bee broken, euen ſo though children may not lawfully marry without conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet being married, they are tied by the couenant of God ech to other, as husband and wife, and may not ſhake off the yoke which they haue taken vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. As for thoſe phraſes of Scripture which are vrged in this behalfe of parents,
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 21.21. Exod. 34.16. Deut. 7.3.</note> 
                  <hi>taking wiues for their ſonnes, or husbands for their daughters, and giuing their ſonnes and daughters in marriage,</hi> they imply indeed the parents right and power for the beſtowing of their children; but yet we cannot from thence argue, that if the children preuent their parents, and doe giue and beſtow themſelues, their gift ſhould bee void, and their marriage a meere nullitie, as if it had not beene. For as wee reade of parents <hi>taking wiues for their ſonnes,</hi> ſo we reade of ſonnes alſo without conſent of parents, <hi>taking wiues for themſelues,</hi> when yet the want of ſuch conſent hath been no diſanulling of their marriage.

                  <hi>taking</hi> had been nothing, ſo long as his father and mother ſhould giue no conſent vnto it. So is it ſaid of
<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 38.2.</note> Iudah, <hi>that he tooke him to wife a daughter of a Canaanite,</hi> which wee cannot doubt but that it was as offenſiue to his father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, as it had beene before to Iſaac, and yet his marriage was not taken to be of no effect. To be ſhort, as the one phraſe of Scripture may be deemed to import a right in the father to beſtow the children, ſo the other may bee thought to import a validitie of that which the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, though vnlawfully, without the father. It is here, I know, commonly obiected, that God by his law prouided, that
<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 30.4.</note> the vow of the daughter ſhould not ſtand that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auowed by the father, and thereof is inferred, that the daughters beſtowing of her ſelfe in marriage cannot ſtand good without the father. But that law if it be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, maketh as little to that purpoſe as any thing elſe that is alleaged. For the vowes and bonds there ſpoken of, are of things futurely to be done; but heere the queſtion is of a thing already done. If the daughter made a vow of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to the Lord, it was in the fathers power to diſanull her vow; but if ſhe had alreadie offered any thing to the Lord, it was not then in the fathers power to reuoke her offering. Euen ſo if the daughter make a vow or giue a promiſe that ſhe will marry thus or thus, it is in the hand of the parents to reſiſt and fruſtrate her vow; but if by contract and marriage ſhe haue effected her vow and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is then paſt the parents hands to vndoe what ſhee hath done, and it is not lawfull marriage but adulterie to beſtow her otherwiſe. To conclude this point, it is a true rule in law; <hi>Multa fieri non poſſunt, quae tamen facta valent: Many things may not be done, which yet ſtand good when they are done.</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 4.25.</note> Zipporah might not haue circumciſed her ſonne, but yet when ſhe had done it, there was no reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it.

It is not without cauſe, that I ſay <hi>raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and head-ſtrongly,</hi> becauſe the neceſſitie of parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents is not alwaies abſolutely to be vnderſtood, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes caſes of conſcience by the iniquitie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that doe neceſſarily enforce a mitigation of this law, and rules of this nature are commonly taken to hold onely ordinarily and for the moſt part.

               <p>Anſw. <hi>Their doctrine is most reaſonable and godly: For the firſt motions to ſinne, are rather the actions of the euill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, tempting vs to euill; than of a man, in whoſe minde they are before he is aware of them; and who aſſoone as he beginneth to marke them, diſliketh them and chaſeth them thence: and how can he carrie a right opinion of the milde goodneſſe of God, that thinketh him ſo haſtie with his fraile creature man, as to puniſh him eternally for ſuch a thought, as is thruſt into his minde at vnawares, and may come vpon him in his ſleepe, went he neuer ſo well diſpoſed to bed? See more of this in the queſtion of originall ſinne. To his reaſons to the contrarie, I anſwer to the first, that lust with conſent is not expreſly forbid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commandements, but the act of adulterie and ſtealing: yet, it might well haue beene reduced vnto them, as it is in the other Commandements. Neucrtheleſſe, becauſe our frailty is more prone to the wicked lust of concupiſcence, and deſire of our neighbours goods; it pleaſed God for the better bridling of of them, to giue vs particular precepts againſt them; ſpecially conſidering, that it was alſo very hard, by the dimme light of our darkned reaſon, to diſcerne them to be ſuch capitall ſinnes. And whereas he ſaith, that the Philoſophers knew the inward conſent of our minde, without any exteriour acts to be mortall ſinne: I take him to ſpeake at randome, and more than he can prooue. Sure it is, that many learned</hi> Iewes, <hi>who ſhould know more than Philoſophers,
<note place="margin">Cap. 5.28. &amp; 29.</note> knew not ſo much: as may be gathered out of</hi> S. Matthew, <hi>and out of</hi> Ioſephus, lib. 12. Antiq. c. 13.

               <p>I referre thee heere, gentle Reader, as M. Biſhop doth, to the queſtion of Originall ſin,
<note place="margin">That concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is ſinne in the firſt motions thereof.</note> where it hath been already fully declared that the Romiſh doctrine is neither reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable nor godly which denieth the firſt motions of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence to be ſinne. In the ſixt and eleuenth ſection of that queſtion, thoſe particulars are anſwered, which heere hee fetteth downe in the firſt part of this ſection. I only note therein further, that he <hi>maketh the firſt motions to ſinne, the actions of the euill ſpirit,</hi> contrary to the expreſſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of S. Iames, that

                  <hi>euery man is tempted of his owne lust.</hi> If it be <hi>his owne lust</hi> wherewith he is tempted, then is it not the action of the euill ſpirit: and that it is the action of the perſon, is ſhewed in the third ſection of the aforeſaid que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. His anſwers to M. Perkins are vnſufficient. The queſtion is, whether conſents to wicked luſts be forbidden by the ſeuerall commandements to which the acts of them doe belong. Our Sauiour Chriſt briefly decideth it, that
<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 5.28.</note> 
                  <hi>to looke vpon a woman to lust after her,</hi> is the breach of the ſeuenth commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie.</hi> Now if the luſt of adulterie with conſent be forbidden by the ſeuench commandement, then that which is forbidden by the tenth is luſt without conſent. Now ſuch luſts with conſent M. Biſhop confeſſeth are forbidden in the other Commandements; onely they belong not to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements againſt adulterie and ſtealing. And why? <hi>Becauſe our frailtie,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is more prone to the wicked lust of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and deſire of other mens goods, it pleaſed God to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:643:156"/>giue particular precepts of them.</hi> But that is not true, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the one of theſe, that wee are more prone to theſe than to other luſts; for wee are as prone to ſelfe-loue and pride, and wilfulneſſe, to hypocriſie and lying, to malice and enuy, and wrathfulneſſe, and ſundry other like ſinnes, to ſay nothing of the luſts that tend to the breach of the firſt table of the law. The cauſe why God would exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie luſt by thoſe particulars, is becauſe thoſe are moſt familiar and ſenſible, and of them groweth the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But diſtruſting that reaſon, he addeth another of more ſpecialtie, which maketh ſpecially againſt himſelfe. <hi>Specially conſidering,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it is very hard by the dimme light of our darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reaſon, to diſcerne them to be ſuch capitall ſinnes.</hi> But by what reaſon I maruell doth hee make theſe more <hi>capitall ſinnes</hi> than all the reſt? Is not the luſt of murther as <hi>capitall</hi> as the luſt of adulterie? Is not the motion and will of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring parents, and rebelling againſt Princes as hainous as the deſire of other mens goods? And doth not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe preſently ſignifie that it is as hard <hi>by the dimme light of our darkened reaſon to diſcerne them alſo to bee ſuch capitall ſinnes;</hi> inaſmuch as the Philoſophers, as he ſaith, in whom was the greateſt light of reaſon, did not ſee ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any <hi>conſent of minde without the exteriour act.</hi> If it be not as hard to diſcerne the one as the other, let him giue vs reaſon of the difference. If it be as hard, and there be in that reſpect no difference, then let him acknowledge that there was as great reaſon of giuing particular precepts againſt the luſts of other ſinnes, as of adulterie and theft; which being not done, let him acknowledge as the truth is, that the luſts of adulterie and theft, where conſent is yeelded to them, are as in the heart reputed for the acts themſelues, as by the former words of Chriſt is teſtified, and therefore are forbidden by the ſeuenth and eighth commandements; and therefore that it is very luſt it ſelfe, without conſent that is forbidden by the tenth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.

               <p>
                  <hi>Maſter</hi> PER. <hi>beginneth with it thus.</hi> The Lords Praier is a moſt abſolute forme of praier: now in this wee are taught to direct our praiers to God alone, Our father, &amp;c. and that onely in the name and mediation of Chriſt; for God is our father onely by Chriſt: therefore to vſe any mediation of Saints is needleſſe.</p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>We allow our Lords praier to be a most perfect forme of praier: yet hold that many other ſort of praiers may be made vnto God very acceptably, as ſundry other praiers vſed by Chriſt, and ſet downe in the Goſpell doe teach vs: and therefore to argue, that becauſe one praier of Chriſts making is directed to God, that no other may bee made to any Saint, is very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh. Wee gather praier to Saints out of</hi> S. Pauls <hi>requesting the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Corinthians, <hi>and others to pray for him:
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:643:166"/>and out of the mediation of the woman of</hi> Cananea <hi>to Christ for her daughter: and the Diſciples ſpeaking to Christ for her; with ſuch like, both out of the old and new Testament. For if it had been either needleſſe or bootleſſe, to haue praied vnto God any otherwiſe, than in the name and by the mediation of Chriſt; then S. Paul would not haue requeſted the helpe of mortall mens praiers to God for him: and if poore ſinners praiers may helpe vs, much more may the interceſſion of the glorious Saints do, who are in far greater fauor with God: See the queſtion of interceſſion of Saints. Againe, if that only forme of praier were to be vſed, neither were it lawfull to pray to Christ himſelfe; neither could it bee prooued thereby, that we ſhould praie in Chriſts name. For there is no expreſſe mention of Chriſts name; neither any petition for Chriſts ſake. For God may bee truely called</hi> our Father, <hi>in that he immediately createth and giueth vs our ſoules, which is more than our bodies, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from our carnall fathers.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Lords praier exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth praier to Saints.</note> as M. Biſhop alloweth it to bee, then are we perfectly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by directed, both to whom and for what we are to praie. It cannot bee called a <hi>moſt perfect forme of praier,</hi> wherein there is any want of either of theſe things. To adde any thing to that that is perfect, is to denie the perfection of it, and to take away any thing from it, is to make it maimed and vnperfect. Seeing then by <hi>the moſt perfect forme of praier,</hi> we are inſtructed to pray no otherwiſe but to God onely, it followeth neceſſarily, that praier to Saints is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, becauſe it is exorbitant from that moſt <hi>perfect forme.</hi> M. Biſhops exception heereto is very childiſh and vaine, that <hi>other praiers may be made vnto God very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and that other praiers are vſed by Chriſt, and ſet downe in the Goſpel,</hi> becauſe in other praiers there may bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in the praiers ſet downe in the Goſpel there is nothing, but what is conſonant and agreeable to this form.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:643:167"/>For though praier be conceiued in other words, yet it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth not from this forme, ſo long as wee pray to no other but to whom in this forme wee are directed, nor for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but what in this praier is concluded. And albeit M. Biſhop can alleage, that in the Goſpell and otherwhere there are other praiers vſed and ſet down beſide the Lords praier, yet in the whole courſe of Scripture can hee finde vs no example of any praier but to God alone. If hee did bring vs example of praier to Saints, ſomewhat it were, but now it is idle that he alleageth that there are praiers in other words. But he telleth vs <hi>that they gather praier to Saints out of S. Pauls requesting the Romans, Corinthians, &amp; others to pray for him.</hi> And well indeed they may, if they can prooue that S. Paul in the ſame ſort praid to the Romans &amp; others to pray for him, as they pray to the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if that which S. Paul did, were but a familiar requeſt of mutuall charitie, wheras their praier to Saints is a ſeruice of religious dutie; and hee did beſeech them onely as fellow members of the ſame body to giue aſſiſtance to his praiers, not as Mediatours, as they make the Saints to obteine for their ſakes the acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then doth M. Biſhop ſhew himſelfe a ridiculous man, that will draw from the one of theſe a concluſion of the other. Or if he will needs confound the one of theſe with the other, it ſhall be well that his diſciples that craue the help of his praiers do take their ghoſtly father and ſet him vp like ſweete S. Rood, and deuoutly kneele downe and pray vnto him. But if to craue ech others praiers be piety, and to doe that ech to other which they doe to the Saints be damnable idolatrie, then it is apparent that they gather that which was neuer ſowed, and doe colourably alleage theſe inſtances for the abuſing and blinding of ſimple men. As for
<note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 15.22.</note> the woman of Canaan, we reade that ſhe praied to Chriſt for her daughter, but we doe not reade that her daughter praied to her; and wee finde that by her praier ſhe ſhewed her compaſſion, but that ſhee tooke

But M.

As for <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Saints</hi> wee know God fauoureth vs no leſſe than hee fauoureth them, being redeemed with the ſame bloud, and by one ſpirit ſealed to the ſame hope; and no more will hee ſuffer an elect to periſh on earth, than he will ſuffer a Saint to periſh in heauen. Whatſoeuer M.

Now heere againe, <hi>ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the queſtion of the interceſſion of Saints,</hi> whereas he hath taken paines to skip ouer that queſtion alſo, and hath ſaid nothing of it. But remembring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee goeth further heere and ſaith, that <hi>if that onely forme of praier were to be vſed, neither were it lawfull to pray to Chriſt himſelfe, neither could it be prooued thereby that we ſhould pray in Chriſts name.</hi> As if any of vs doe ſay, that that onely forme of praier is to bee vſed, who doe commonly our ſelues vſe other formes of praier, and condemne them that hold it vnlawfull ſo to doe. Wee onely ſay, as hath beene alreadie declared, that no praier is to be made, the matter and ſubſtance wherof is not conteined in the Lords praier. And though that onely forme were to bee vſed, yet it followeth not that Chriſt is not to bee praied vnto, becauſe Chriſt is that God who is our heauenly father, and therefore to Chriſt alſo wee pray when wee ſay; <hi>Our father which art in heauen.</hi> Neither doth it follow that then we ſhold not pray in the name of Chriſt, becauſe it ſhould
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:643:168"/>nothing detract from the perfection of this form of praier, that we be otherwhere taught to make this praier in the name of Chriſt. Albeit the praier it ſelfe, though not in words, yet in effect leadeth vs thereunto, becauſe God is <hi>our Father</hi> no otherwiſe but in Chriſt, who hath taken vs into his communion and fellowſhip where he hath ſaid;

               <p>It will be well for M.

                  <hi>wiſedome to redeeme the time,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth, ſurely it is a point of folly to eſteem ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of miſſpending time; and hee will not ſo eaſily ſwallow
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:643:172"/>idle words, that regardeth what our Sauiour ſaith that
<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 12.36. No man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth without breach of Gods law.</note> 
                  <hi>of euery idle word that men ſhall ſpeake they ſhall giue account at the day of iudgement.</hi> To come to the matter, M. Perkins reaſon is very good, There can be no forfaiture without breach of the condition of a bond. Euery ſinne is a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore euery ſinne is a breach of the condition of a bond. The obligation or bond here is the law of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then euery ſinne, and therefore euery veniall ſinne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man ſubiect to a forfeiture of puniſhment, it muſt needs be that euery veniall ſinne muſt be holden to bee a breach of the law of God. And becauſe no man can liue without daily committing veniall ſinnes, therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that no man can liue without daily breach of the law of God. I diſpute not heere whether ſinne be rightly called <hi>veniall</hi> in his ſenſe or not; I aime at the point, that becauſe no man by their confeſſion can liue without venial finnes for which he daily ſaith, <hi>forgiue vs our treſpaſſes,</hi> and euery veniall ſinne is a breach of the law of God, therefore no man can liue without daily breach of Gods law, and therefore that no man in this life doth fulfill the law. But well fare a ſchoole-tricke yet that ſhall put this argument quite out: forſooth there is a twofold bond whence the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture ariſeth. One is the law of God, and veniall ſinnes he telleth vs are not <hi>against the law directly; wee are not bound to auoid them by any preſcript law directly.</hi> Thus faintly and fearefully he ſpeaketh: his owne conſcience telleth him that they are againſt the law of God, but being loth to confeſſe the truth, which thus notwithſtanding reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer him, he minceth the matter with <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly.</hi> But if the curſe of God which is the penaltie of the law doe light vpon him for theſe ſinnes, what ſhall it boote him to ſay, that he did but <hi>indirectly</hi> runne into it? Well they are not <hi>directly against the law,</hi> but againſt what are they directly? <hi>They are,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>against the bond of ſome morall dutie, and we are bound in reaſon to auoid them.</hi> Heere is then the other obligation or bond, <hi>the bond of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:643:173"/>the bond of morall duty.</hi> But is there any bond of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dutie but only the law of God? and doth not the law perfectly determine all morall duty? or doth the reaſon of man find it ſelfe otherwiſe bound than by the conſcience of the law? Surely <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,

               <p>In the laſt words: <hi>and lead vs not into temptation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.1.</note> wee pray not <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that God ſhould free vs from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for it is otherwhiles good to be tempted: but that wee be not left vnto the malice of Satan, and held captiue of the temptation: for heere to be led into temptation, and to be deliuered, are oppoſed. Now hence I gather, that hee who is the childe of God truely iuſtified and ſanctified, ſhall neuer fall wholly and finally from the grace of God; and I conclude on this maner:
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That which we aske according to the will of God, ſhall be granted:</hi> But this the childe of God asketh, that he might neuer be wholly forſaken of his father, and led captiue into temptation: this therfore ſhall be granted.</p>

Againe, he miſtaketh the true ſenſe of that petition: for therein we do not aske that we continue not in ſin, which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the former petition</hi> (forgiue vs our treſpaſſes) <hi>but wee pray that we be not ouercome by the diuell, by yeelding our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the temptation, and ſo fall into ſinne. Laſtly he forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe much when he ſaith,</hi> that it is good to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>for he holdeth for certaine, that the very firſt motions to ſinne in vs (which is the beginning of the temptation) are mortall ſinnes; and ſo by himſelfe, it is good to fall into mortall ſinne, if it be good we ſhould be tempted.</hi>

               <p>Many there are who are Chriſtians in name,
<note place="margin">The true Chriſtian ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> but not in deed; Chriſtians to men, but not to God, Chriſtians by outward profeſſion and partitipation of Sacraments, but not by inward regeneration and grace.

Now of them that are truely the children of God, and do faithfully and truely pray, it is vndoubtedly true which M.

But by the remainder of the corruption of fleſh and of the old man, there is a let that Gods name is not perfectly ſanctified in vs, his kingdome taketh not full place in vs, neither doe we his will in ſuch meaſure as we ought to doe.

                  <hi>Before the words of Chriſt that which is offered is bread; but when the words of Christ are vttered, it is not now termed bread, but it is called the body.</hi> M. Biſhop falſifieth the words: but taking them as they are, what doth hee finde in them, for aſſertion of the reall preſence? Is it anie proofe of reall preſence, to ſay that the Sacrament <hi>is called</hi>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:643:177"/>the body of Chriſt? Now as it is called the body of Chriſt, ſo is it alſo called <hi>ſuperſubſtantiall bread,</hi> not for that that it is really to the mouth &amp; belly, but for that that it ſignifieth and preſenteth to our faith. And this doth Ambroſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe immediately declare when hee addeth,
<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. Non iſte panis eſt, qui vadit in corpus, ſed ille panis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae eternae qui anima nostrae ſubstantiam fulcit.</note> 
                  <hi>for it is not this bread which paſſeth into the body, but that bread of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life that vpholdeth the ſubſtance of our ſoule.</hi> Where when he deuideth <hi>the bread of eternall life,</hi> from that <hi>which goeth into the bodie,</hi> hee plainly ſheweth, that <hi>that which goeth into the body,</hi> is not the reall body of Chriſt, which is the bread of eternall life.

He ſaith, that <hi>theſe can with no more reaſon be denied to be theirs, then the reſt of their works:</hi> But I anſwer him, that though there were no other reaſon, yet it is ſufficient reaſon for vs to bee ſuſpicious of theſe, becauſe in them ſome things are ſet downe, whereof in the reſt of their vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted workes, and in the infinite volumnes of antiquitie which are approoued and acknowledged, there is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be found.

To anſwer this M. Biſhop wee
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:643:181"/>ſee is ſomewhat hardly beſtead, and forceth the words of Chriſt to another order than the Euangeliſts and <hi>S. Paul</hi> haue obſerued in the deliuering of them. Yea hee croſſeth the Canon of the Maſſe of rather ſetteth the Canon of the Maſſe at variance with the inſtitution of Chriſt. In a word hee ſaith hee knoweth not what, and and cannot tell what to ſay. The Euangeliſts and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle conſtantly and with one conſent put <hi>bleſſing</hi> before <hi>breaking;</hi> but he ſaith that Chriſt firſt <hi>brake</hi> and then <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> He ſaith that it was bread which Chriſt brake, but if it were bread which Chriſt brake, then what is it which the Prieſt breaketh? If it be bread, then there is no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. If it be not bread, then he ſwarueth from Chriſts inſtitution. Hee maketh Chriſt to breake the hoſt before conſecration; but the Maſſe-prieſt breaketh it not till after conſecration. How then ſhall the Maſſe-book and the Goſpell be thought to agree together? All this it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he runneth into becauſe he cannot tell how it ſhould be ſaid that Chriſt did breake himſelfe which was the thing that M. Perkins vrged.

               <p>Anſw. <hi>He began to ſet downe the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of</hi> S. Paul, 1. Cor. 11. <hi>heere he leapeth backe to S.</hi> Mathew, <hi>becauſe he fitteth him better in this point: to whom I anſwer, that Chriſt there ſpake only vnto his twelue Apoſtles, who were afterward to administer that holy Sacrament to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and ſo ſomething ther-about is ſpoken to them which may not bee extended vnto lay-men, but vnto</hi> Prieſts <hi>onely, who were to ſucceed the Apoſtles in that miniſtery.

But to come to the purpoſe, when they quarrell with vs for taking away from the people one kind of the Sacrament: we anſwer, that we doe them no hinderance thereby; becauſe we giue them both the bleſſed body, and ſacred bloud of Chriſt together vnder one kinde: yea whole Christ, both God and man; becauſe they be ſo vnited that they cannot be ſeparated. But what can they anſwer, when we complaine vpon them, for that they haue defrauded the poore people, of both body and

               <p>Whether it bee S. Mathew or S. Paul, they ſerue both for the confirming of one truth, and doe both condemne the Antichriſtian and damnable ſacriledge of the Church of Rome, in maiming the Sacrament of Chriſt contrary to the inſtitution of Chriſt himſelfe, to the very intention and purpoſe of the Sacrament, to the example and practiſe of all ancient churches. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith:
<note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Drinke yee all of this.</hi> But the Church of Rome ſaith; Not ſo, for there are iuſt and reaſonable cauſes why it is not fit that all drinke therof, but it is ſufficient that the Prieſt alone drinke for all. M. Biſhop to make this good, telleth vs that Chriſt <hi>there ſpake to his Apostles onely, and that ſome thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about is ſpoken to them, which may not bee extended vnto lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but vnto Prieſts onely.</hi> But how will hee make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that Chriſt in the one part of the Sacrament ſpake to the Apoſtles onely, and not in the other alſo? There were none there preſent but the Apoſtles, and what direction haue we in the words of Chriſt, to reſtraine the vſe of the cup, as peculiar to the Prieſts, and to make the other common to the people? And if Chriſt did ſo intend, how falleth it out that the Apoſtle S. Paul in the recitall of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:643:187"/>Chriſts inſtitution, profeſſing
<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.23</note> 
                  <hi>to deliuer</hi> preciſely <hi>what he had receiued of the Lord,</hi> maketh no mention of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint? and what preſumption was it in the whole primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, contrary to that intendment, to make that common to the laitie, which Chriſt had made the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the Prieſts onely? He ſaith, that <hi>others may drinke of it, or not drinke of it, as it ſhall be thought moſt expedient by the Pope,</hi> whom hee falſly nameth <hi>the ſupreme Paſtour.</hi> But how may it appeere that there is any ſuch authoritie left to the Pope? Surely, if Chriſt ſpake only to the Prieſts, it ſhould not ſeeme likely that the Pope ſhould haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to extend this fauour to the people; and if the Pope may giue libertie heereof to the people, then it is certaine that Chriſt did not ſpeake only to the Prieſts. But there is a ſpeciall ſecret heere which I would gladly haue M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to vnfold: for if the words of Chriſt, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> were ſpoken onely to Prieſts, and doe belong to them, how is it that

                  </note> Prieſts alſo in the church of Rome, he only excepted that miniſtreth, are excluded from being partakers of the cuppe? Chriſt ſaith, by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Drinke all yee Priests;</hi> how impudently then doe they tranſgreſſe the commandement of Chriſt who barre all Prieſts from the Cup but him only that ſaith Maſſe? Here their wicked and damnable hypocriſie moſt plainly appeareth, and the knots wherewith they are tied are ſuch, as that they know not which way to vntie them. The Prieſts that miniſter not, are with them in that behalfe as in the caſe of lay-men, and therefore are forbidden to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the cup. But in that caſe alſo the Apoſtles were at the inſtitution of the Sacrament; for Chriſt only mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and not any of them. And yet to the Apoſtles being thus as in the ſtate and condition of lay men, becauſe they miniſtred not, our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Drinke ye all of this.</hi> What now followeth hereof, but that to lay men, and of lay men as well as of Prieſts, our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this;</hi> euen you all that haue eaten of this bread,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:643:187"/>drinke ye alſo of this cup? But <hi>all men confeſſe,</hi> ſaith M.

For thoſe words haue reference to the whol celebration of this myſtery, requiring the ſame to be performed in remembrance of him by whom it was firſt ordained. Yea and that they haue their reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, appeareth plainly by the very coherence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof;
<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26.26. Luke 22.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Take, eat; doe this,</hi> namely that I haue bidden you doe, to take and eat, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> And this is as cleere in the Apoſtles deſcription of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cup;
<note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.25</note> 
                  <hi>He tooke the cup, ſaying, This cup is the new testament in my blood which is ſhed for you; this doe as oft as ye drinke it in remembrance of me.</hi> Which later words ſound plainly to this effect; <hi>Drinke ye all of this, and as oft as ye do ſo, doe it in the remembrance of me.</hi> But yet we will deale cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly with M. Biſhop, and grant him his deſire, that Chriſt here ſpeaketh of the miniſtration of the ſacrament which appertaineth to the Clergy alone; and will he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conclude that when hee ſaith <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> his meaning was that the Clergy only ſhould drinke thereof? Verily the contrary rather moſt plainly followeth. For when he ſaith, <hi>Doe this,</hi> what elſe doth he ſay, but what ye ſee me doe, the ſame doe ye; I ſay to you all here preſent, <hi>Take and eat;</hi> I deliuer the cup to you all that you may all drinke thereof; doe you adminiſter to others in the ſame ſort; what I haue done to you, the ſame doe you to them in remembrance of me.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:643:188"/>Prieſt doth truely ſupply the roome of Chriſt, who imitateth that which Chriſt hath done; that we ought to doe nothing but what he hath done; that ſo often as we offer the cup in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Lord and of his paſſion, wee are to doe the ſame which we are aſſured Christ did.</hi> Now if the miniſter bee to doe the ſame that Chriſt did, then is he to adminiſter both parts of the ſacrament alike to all that are preſent, becauſe we find that Chriſt did ſo.

Biſhop looking to the outward ſignes in the Lords ſupper, taketh the ſame to be a ſimple token of Chriſts exceeding loue towards vs, a matter that any man might doe; and not ſo much as that that Elias left to his ſcholar Elizeus. Thus in his blinde fancie hee amplifieth the matter as if wee taught that Chriſt in his laſt ſupper had recommended nothing to vs but bread and wine. But let him vnderſtand that we ſee and teach in this ſacrament, the exceeding great loue of Chriſt, not in thoſe ſimple creatures which we ſee in act, but in the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of grace which is promiſed in effect. If wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe creatures in act, they are but bread and wine, but conſider them in vſe and effect, and then this bread is heauenly bread, the bread of life, the food of immortalitie; there is in it the ſpirit of Chriſt, euen the power of the word of God, not onely feeding but alſo ſanctifying and clenſing the ſoule. I will expreſſe it by M.

                  <hi>Moreouer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the institution of a religious rite and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to be vſed in the whole Church vnto the worlds end, and to be receiued of all Chriſtian people of age and diſcretion, did neceſſarily require that it ſhould bee done in most certaine and cleare tearmes; otherwiſe, there might ariſe great ſtrife and contention about it, and be the ruine of thouſands. And ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally great perſpicuitie is required in this holy Sacrament, where the miſtaking of it, muſt needs breeed either idolatrie, if wee worſhip for Chriſt, that which is not Chriſt: or impietie, if on the other ſide we ſhould not giue to it (being Chriſt God and man) diuine honour. Wherefore, no good Chriſtian may thinke, but that our prouident Sauiour Christ Ieſus, who verie well foreſaw all theſe inconueniences, did deliuer it in ſuch tearmes as he would haue to be taken properly, and not be conſtrued at mens pleaſures figuratiuely. Adde, that hee ſpake thoſe words to the twelue Apoſtles onely, whom hee was accuſtomed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct plainly, and not in parable darkely; and who were woont alſo to aske for the interpretation of obſcure ſpeeches, who here made no question about this high myſterie, becauſe they were ſufficiently forewarned,</hi> that they ſhould eat Chriſts fleſh,

                  <hi>the ſignes, and the things ſignified are reckoned by the ſame names,</hi> being both termed the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt.

In a word our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt though he ſpake by a figure, yet ſpake ſo, as that not <hi>at mens pleaſures,</hi> but according to the courſe of Gods word he might eaſely be vnderſtood. And as for the Apoſtles, we cannot doubt but that they were ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in thoſe other ſignes and ſacraments wherewith they had beene before acquainted, as that they could not make any ſcruple or queſtion what his meaning was in the inſtitution of this. Therefore no cauſe was there for them to be troubled, or to aske interpretation heere, as of ſome darke and obſcure matter, but there had beene cauſe for them to haue queſtioned many things in the words of Chriſt, according to that interpretation which the Church of Rome hath made thereof. For though Chriſt ſpake to

The ſeale indeed is but wax; it is but a ſigne and token of ſomewhat, but yet it ſerueth to giue aſſurance of the legacies for confirmation whereof it is appointed. The new teſtament of Chriſt is, the couenant and promiſe of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes purchaſed by his bloud. This hath he publiſhed by the Goſpell to all that repent and beleeue in him. For confirmation heereof he hath put to his Sacrament as a ſeale, thereby to deliuer after a ſort, and to put into our hands the thing which he hath promiſed; euen as hee who hath receiued a ſeale preſumeth that thereby hee hath in effect the thing that is ſealed vnto him. And ſhall a man ſay that Chriſt in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs this ſeale, hath bequeathed to vs no other but a figure, a ſignification or repreſentation of ſomwhat, and not the thing it ſelfe that is repreſented thereby? If it be abſurd to ſay ſo in humane teſtaments and wils, what meaneth M. Biſhop to transferre ſuch an abſurditie to thoſe things that are diuine? I need not ſtand vpon this matter; I ſay briefly, that it is idle to ſay that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the chiefeſt legacie that Chriſt hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. He hath bequeathed vnto vs himſelfe, the fruit of his paſſion, the riches of his grace, the inheritance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, which hee will vndoubtedly giue to euerie true beleeuer, and in the meane time hath giuen his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to bee to our faith the pledge and aſſurance thereof.</p>
               <p>And thus M. Biſhop telleth vs that he is come at length to the end of his booke; wherein I gheſſe he hath taken ſmall ioy, becauſe he hath quite left out the middle, euen whole twelue queſtions handled by M.

We are beholding to him for that he giueth vs leaue <hi>if any thing heerein bee amiſſe to impute it partly to his ſlender skill, ouerſight, or negligence.</hi> And ſurely, what betwixt his <hi>ſlender skill</hi> one way, and <hi>his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

But hee ſhould haue remembred that hee wrot that Epiſtle to his Prince and Soueraigne, where being charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to haue dealt perfidiouſly with his moſt excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to haue very leaudly attempted to abuſe him with many falſehoods and lies, with many broken and lame concluſions; and that he could not make good that which he had written, he ſhould haue thought, that whatſoeuer became of the reſt of his booke, it concerned him in all loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and duty to yeeld to his Maieſty, a ſpeciall and cleere iuſtification of that Epiſtle. Againe, he knew wel that there were many points handled by occaſion of his Epiſtle, which belong not to any queſtion after enſuing, and that the reſt, though handled other where, yet being heere writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the King, were to be anſwered by me, and therefore maintained by him in the ſame nature wherein they were written; and would he then thus like a micher ſteale away from all, and leaue the chiefe and principall matters of his ſuggeſtion without ſuccour or defenſe? I had often ſaid, and he hath now verified it, that either he would not reply at all, or elſe would doe it in that patching ſort as he hath now done. And ſurely, had not I my ſelfe miniſtred vnto

Vpon mention made of <hi>the Catholike</hi> faith, I tooke occaſion, further than I was compelled by him, to inſiſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of Catholike, and to ſhew their abuſe thereof. Vpon his appeale to the Romane Church, when the ſame was in the beſt and moſt flouriſhing eſtate, I tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a compariſon of the doctrine, of the old and new Church of Rome, by ſundry ſentences of the Biſhops and other writers of that Church, whereas, it had beene ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me to haue diſprooued thoſe inſtances whereby he tooke vpon him to prooue the ſame faith in both. From theſe two points ariſeth the whole ſubſtantiall part of his booke, and had I omitted theſe, in hard caſe had he beene for the writing of a booke; for, for defenſe of his owne alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he had had nothing more to ſay. Now gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to confeſſe to thee the truth, I had determined ſo ſoone as time ſhould ſerue, by a ſpeciall treatiſe to enlarge the ſaid compariſon and to remooue their exceptions which they haue to take againſt it, and ſo more fully to deſcribe, <hi>The true ancient Romane Catholike.</hi> What then hath M.

For the doing of this, I muſt craue thy patience for a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a matter that will require conuenient time; but in the meane time, to giue thee ſome ſatisfaction as touching that <hi>Reproofe,</hi> I haue thought good by a ſhort Adueriſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make it appeare to thee, that <hi>Foxes whelpes are all alike,</hi> &amp; that M.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:643:201"/>to teſtimony, and reaſon to reaſon; wherefore they thought it beſt policy to make choice of ſom iolly ſmooth-tongued diſcourſer, that might with a ruffling multitude of faire plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing words cary his Reader from the matter.</hi> Thus he is all <hi>marrow and pith,</hi> a terrible man, our graue wiſe men in high authority were afraid of him, they were put to their ſhifts to haue his booke anſwered; as for me I am no body, all words and no woorth; a man of too little ſubſtance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the profound learning of ſo great a Clerke. I doe him heere a double fauour, both that I traduce not his foolery as it deſerueth, and that I forbeare to giue him a ierke for ſo leaudly demeaning himſelfe towards thoſe graue wiſe men in high authority. But what he is, and what I am is not to be determined by him or mee, God and the Country muſt trie vs both; only this I doe not doubt, that my writings, vnlearned as they are, haue ſet a dagger at his heart, which he ſhall neuer be able to pull away. It appeareth by this Preface, that hee hath heard ſomewhat thereof that pleaſeth him not, whereupon he is growen ſo furiated and enraged, as that he ſpitteth nothing but poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtraineth himſelfe to the vttermoſt, to diſgrace that which he ſeeth to be ſo diſgracefull to himſelfe.

And heere it troubleth him, that to his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, being but one ſheet and a halfe, I ſhould write ſo long an anſwer of thirty ſheetes; but I anſwer him, that in the ſeruice of my Prince, and in a buſines of that nature I was not to huddle vp any thing, but to vnfold and lay open all things, that the truth might the more fully and plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. I doe not wonder that he would haue had me more briefe, becauſe therby his vnhoneſt and ſhamefull dealing ſhould haue beene the leſſe ſeene. In a word, I wrot as the ancient fathers of the Church haue beene wont to doe, not to ſerue the humour of Heretickes and enemies, but as

Now therefore in like ſort though Saint Bernard had beene mine aduerſary profeſſedly writing againſt me, yea though the words had beene M.

As for thoſe matters which M. Biſhop nameth, it is no wonder that Bernard li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in a time of ſo great corruption and declination of Chriſtian faith were ſomewhat intangled in the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that time; wonder it is rather, that in the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall points therof which moſt neerely concerne our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and eternall life, he continued ſo ſincere and ſound as we finde he did. Who although he had a conceit that the church of Rome ſhould not erre in faith, as M. Biſhop alleadgeth out of his Epiſtle to Innocentius, yet if he liued now would diſclaime that conceit, becauſe he ſhould ſee the church of Rome oppugning that Doctrine of the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe by Chriſt which he maintaineth at large in that epiſtle, as I haue
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſect. 6.8.</note> before cited him in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that point. Yea in ſundry points from place to place I haue ſhewed how Bernard fully accordeth with vs, and condemneth the doctrine which the church of Rome hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:643:208"/>ſince drawen out of the puddles of her owne ſchooles; ſo that howſoeuer hee were miſted with ſome ſuperſtitious fancies, yet that letteth not, but that by his iudgement, M.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:643:210"/>yet doth he teach them to be worſhipped as repreſentations of moſt holy perſonages.</hi> But how may this appeare? <hi>Marry, by his letters,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to Secundinus, to whom he ſent the images of our Sauiour, of the bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Mary, and of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Paul.</hi> It is true indeed that Secundinus ſent to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory for the picture of Chriſt, and Gregory ſent it him; ſignifying to him, <hi>that his requeſt did greatly pleaſe him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou loueſt him with all thy heart and whole intention, whoſe image thou deſireſt to haue before thine eies.</hi> Withall hee ſent him thoſe other pictures which M.

               <hi>I know verily that thou doeſt not therefore deſire the image of our Sauiour that thou maiest worſhip it as God, but for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the ſonne of God, that thou maieſt become fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in his loue, whoſe image thou conſidereſt thy ſelfe to behold. And we verily fall not downe before it as before the Godhead, but we worſhip him, whom by the image we remember, either as borne, or hauing ſuffered, or now ſitting vpon his throne. And whileſt the picture, as it were a writing, bringeth to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the Sonne of God, either it reioyceth our minde as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reſurrection, or appeaſeth it by his paſſion.</hi> Now wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Gregory ſaith; <hi>We doe not fall downe or caſt downe our ſelues before it as before the Godhead,</hi> M. Biſhop readeth; <hi>We doe caſt downe our ſelues before the ſaid Image, not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Godhead.</hi> And ſo he vnderſtandeth the former words, <hi>Thou worſhippeſt the image, but thou doeſt not worſhip it as a God,</hi> taking the particle <hi>(as)</hi> to import a diſtinction of the variety of worſhip, which is onely an exemplification of the propriety thereof. For Gregory hath no meaning to inſtruct Secundinus to worſhip the image or to kneele to it which we ſee before is the thing he wholly condemneth, but willeth him to vnderſtand that theſe deuotions belong
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:643:211"/>to God onely, and therefore that he muſt beware not to put the image in the place of God to doe to it thoſe duties of religious humiliation, which are proper to God alone. For as when I ſay of another man, I will not kneele to him as to the king, I doe not meane that I will kneele to him, though not in that maner as to the king; but whereas of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I kneele to the king, I will not kneele to him: ſo when Gregory ſaith to Secundinus, that he is not to <hi>worſhip the image as God, or to kneele before it as before God,</hi> he meaneth not that hee is to worſhip the image or kneele before it, though not in that maner as before God, but that this duty belongeth onely to God, and is not to be performed to the image. And that this may appeare to be Gregory his true meaning, and not any gloſſe of mine, it is vndeniably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Gregory himſelfe, where for concluſion of his inſtructions giuen to Serenus for the quieting of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſaith thus:

               </note> 
               <hi>If any man will make images, forbid him not; but by all meanes auoid the worſhipping of images: but this let your brotherhood carefully aduertiſe them, by the ſight of the ſtory to gather feruency of compunction, but humbly to fall downe or kneele in the worſhip of the holy Trinity onely.</hi> Now if he ſo forbid the worſhipping of images, as that he reſerueth kneeling or caſting downe our ſelues onely to the worſhip of the holy Trinity, let it be eſteemed with what conſcience it is that M. Biſhop ſaith, that <hi>he approoueth the worſhipping of images, euen ſo farre foorth as to kneele before them.</hi> Albeit out of the very words themſelues, the thing is manifeſt; for if Gregory had intended that images though they were not to be worſhipped as Gods, yet were in other ſort to be worſhipped, hee would by the aduerſatiue haue oppoſed worſhip to worſhip, to expreſſe what that ſort of worſhip ſhould be, whereas now he ſetteth worſhip on the one ſide, and onely remembrance on the other ſide, <hi>not to worſhip but for remembrance; not to fall downe before it, but to worſhip Chriſt, whom we remember by it,</hi> ſtill appropriating worſhip to God, but attributing nothing to the image ſaue
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:643:211"/>to be put in minde thereby of him whom it doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Surely a ſenſleſſe thing it is to imagine that hee who would not haue images to be worſhipped as gods, and yet would haue them to be worſhipped, ſhould neuer direct in what ſort they ſhould be worſhipped, but teach abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we haue ſeene, by all means to auoid the worſhipping of them. M. Biſhop ſaith, that he hath <hi>diuers other places</hi> to make good that meaning of Gregory: but he abuſeth his Reader therein; hee hath not one place more whereby to make any ſhew of it, and therfore I hope it plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that I haue not <hi>wrongfully alleaged Gregories words,</hi> but haue iuſtly affirmed that he in this point directly croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the doctrine and practiſe of the now-church of Rome.</p>

Againe, whereas I alleage Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius onely as a party-witneſſe, he peruerteth my words, as if I made him a witneſſe of the whole.

Yea he produceth a Charter of the Church of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury yet extant and to be ſeene, which was granted and confirmed by King Ethelbert, and by Auſtin accepted and ſubſcribed the ſame yeare that that was done, whereby it is without all controuerſie manifeſt and cleere that it is falſe which M. Biſhop ſaith, that Auſtin was dead many yeares before. And for ſome further coniecture of this matter, I wil not omit to note out of Doct.

For although he mention the ſaid <hi>Talieſſin</hi> as hauing beene a writer in the yeare 540. yet becauſe there can be imagined no occaſion of thoſe words before Auſtins comming in, I conceiue that either there is ſome errour in the notation of the time, or that liuing perhaps to great yeeres, as in thoſe daies was no rare thing, he wrot <hi>the Ode,</hi> whence thoſe verſes are taken, in his laſt time. I will define nothing heereof, but leaue it to the iudgement of the Reader to conceiue as he ſeeth cauſe.

            <p>Where when he nameth <hi>Romiſhwolues,</hi> we cannot doubt but that he alludeth to ſome cruelty, cauſed or practiſed by ſome that came from Rome; which becauſe it can haue no application in thoſe times but only to the ſlaughter of the Monkes aforeſaid, therefore I doubt not but that it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Auſtin the Monke, who came then from Rome, as the cauſe of that ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe we are in hand with falſifications and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions, I hold it not amiſſe to reduce hither two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taxations of his of the ſame nature, as moſt properly belonging to this place. The firſt by order of my booke is a place of Mathew Paris, by whom I ſay it appeareth, that
<note n="a" place="margin">Anſwer to the epiſtle, ſect. 3. pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>for the ſpace of twelue hundred yeeres after Chriſt, the Popes authoritie could gaine no acknowledgement in Scotland, for that in the time of King Henry the third (the one and twentith of his raigne) when the Popes Legate would haue entred into Scotland to viſit the Churches there, the King of Scots Alexander the ſecond, forbad him ſo to do, alleaging that none of his predeceſſours had admitted any ſuch, neither would hee ſuffer it, and therefore willed him at his owne perill to forbeare.</hi> Concerning this allegation, M. Biſhop ſetteth downe a poſtſcript in the end of his booke, when all the reſt was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:643:217"/>in this curteous maner; <hi>Curteous Reader, I muſt needs acquaint thee with a notable legerdemaine, which by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing the authour, I found out after the reſt was printed.</hi> Now gentle Reader, I know thou lookeſt for ſome ſpeciall great matter, which he was thus carefull to adde after all the reſt was printed; but what is it I pray? <hi>M. Abbot,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to prooue that the Pope had no authoritie in Scotland twelue hundred yeeres after Chriſt, auerreth that Alexander the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vtterly forbad the Popes Legate to enter within his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is not true.</hi> No is? Surely then M. Abbot dealt very vndutifully with his Prince, to delude him with a falſe tale. But I pray you, M. Biſhop, tell vs what the truth is? <hi>For his authour Mathew Paris declareth,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that the King indeed did at the firſt oppoſe himſelfe againſt that viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his kingdome to be made by the ſaid Legate, not for that he did not acknowledge the Popes ſupreme authoritie in thoſe eccleſiasticall cauſes, but becauſe it was needleſſe, the matters of the Church being (as he ſaid) in good order, and for feare of ouer-great charges.</hi> And is this all M. Biſhop, that you could finde, peruſing the authour ſo diligently as you haue done? But I pray you put on your ſpectacles once more, and turne ouer your booke againe. Thou ſhalt vnderſtand gentle Reader, that the impreſſion of Mathew Paris which I follow, is that

               <hi>The Lord Legate being deſirous to enter into the kingdome of Scotland, there to deale in Eccleſiaſticall matters, as he had done in England, the King of Scotland anſwered him, I remember not that I haue ſeene any Legate in my countrey, nor that there hath beene any need, thanks be to God, that any ſhould be called, neither is there yet any need; all things are well. No, nor in the time of my Father, or of any of my predeceſſours, hath any Legate beene ſeene to

               <hi>In thoſe daies,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Legate hastened to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scotland, and before hee was come into the kingdome of Scotland, the King met him, not liking well of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. For he ſaid that neuer any Legate, beſide him, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Scotland, for there was, as he ſaid, no neede; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity flouriſhed there, and the Church was in good caſe. And vpon multiplying of words, when the King was almoſt ready to chide, there was a writing drawen betwixt them by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Nobles of both kingdomes; the tenor whereof was, that there ſhould neuer any cuſtome grow by reaſon of his ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:643:218"/>and that at his departure he ſhould ſeale that writing, and this was procured that he might not returne into England with diſgrace, as hauing receiued a repulſe. But whileſt the King was abiding in the innermoſt parts of his country, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, without the Kings licence, priuily and ſuddenly departed and tooke away with him the writing aforeſaid.</hi> Heere we ſee by both theſe places, that the King of Scotland denied the Popes Legate any entrance into his land, proteſting that neuer in his time, or in the time of his predeceſſours, any Legate had beene admitted there; and although he were content the ſecond time vpon interceſſion to giue him leaue to viſit that once, to quit him from diſgrace, yet it was with caution, that no cuſtome ſhould grow thereof, neither ſhould that example be pleaded to doe the like another time. May I not then heere ſay of M. Biſhop as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of Adimantus the Manichee;
<note n="e" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>O leaud man preſuming of the negligence of men for the hiding of his owne coſenage and deceit,</hi> that did not thinke that any man would be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as to take the booke, and by ſearching finde out how falſely and trecherouſly he dealeth in theſe things. Is this his <hi>conuincing of me to be ſo perfidious and without all conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in alleging ancient authours as that no man can repoſe truſt in my allegations,</hi> as he heere of inferreth? Ah wretched man that thus maketh hauocke of his owne conſcience, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his ſoule to ſale for the defenſe of an vniuſt and wicked cauſe. As for that which he further alleageth, that the ſaid King did afterwards acknowledge the Popes Legate; and by his letters profeſſe that hee and his heires were and would be obedient to his iuriſdiction and cenſures, though I finde no ſuch matter by his quotation, yet though it were ſo, it skilleth not. I queſtion not what befell after, but what had beene before, knowing that the Pope where he had once ſet in foot was heedy to take all aduantages and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ſpecially of the diſtreſſes and troubles of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to winde himſelfe further in. And therefore as little to the purpoſe is that which he alleageth, where by order he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:643:218"/>anſwereth this matter, that when
<note n="f" place="margin">Reproofe, pag. 122.</note> 
               <hi>King Edward the third,</hi> as he nameth him, indeed <hi>the firſt, would haue giuen to the Scots Iohn Baliol to be their King, they anſwerd him, that they would not accept him without the Popes conſent, who had their country in protection,</hi> which was fiue and fifty yeere after the Legates firſt attempt to enter into that land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no preiudice to that that I haue ſaid.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The other point that I haue thought fit to touch in this place concerneth the opinion of Proclus the Origeniſt heretike, of whom M. Biſhop alledged to the King, that <hi>he taught as we doe, that ſinne in baptiſme is not wholly taken away, but only couered,</hi> citing Epiphanius, as mentioning him for this opinion to be an heritike.
<note n="g" place="margin">Anſwer to the epiſtle. ſect. 7. pag. 49.</note> I anſwered him as the truth is, that by this allegation hee had ſheathed a ſword in his owne ſide, for that vnder the name of Proclus he had by errour cited the opinion of Methodius an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and godly Biſhop of Tyrus, approued alſo by Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and therefore had at once produced two ancient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes teaching by his owne confeſſion as we doe, that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne in baptiſme is not wholly taken away, but that the filth thereof cleaueth faſt to vs ſo long as we continue in the frailty of this life. The matter being cleere and euident by that that I alledged, I told him that either he read the place too early in the morning, or too late at night, or elſe borrowed it from ſome of his Maſters the Ieſuites, who make little conſcience what they ſay. Now I finde ſince, that as almoſt in all the reſt, ſo in this alſo

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:643:219"/>needes out with that that he had to ſay of this matter. And heerein he mightily beſtirreth himſelfe, he ſetteth downe opinions, noteth diuiſions and coherence of ſpeeches, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth circumſtances, looketh into the Latin, looketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Greeke, taxeth me for <hi>ſhameleſſe audacity,</hi> for <hi>ſimple and ſhallow wit,</hi> for <hi>careleſneſſe of credit in thruſting out ſuch an impudent aſſertion;</hi> for <hi>groſſe ignorance;</hi> and in a word telleth me that I am <hi>paſt all ſhame, and worthy to be thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Aſſes skin.</hi> But what, M.

Proclus held that the ſame body ſhall not riſe againe. The authour of that diſcourſe prooueth that the ſame body ſhall riſe againe. Therefore the authour of that diſcourſe was not Proclus but Methodius, which being approoued by Epiphanius, my former ſpeech is iuſtified, that theſe two ancient godly Biſhops, Methodius and Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius did teach as the Proteſtants doe, that ſinne is not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rooted out or taken away by baptiſme, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the regenerate ſo long as this life continueth.

Surely he that thus crieth out with a wide mouth of falſifications and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and in a whole booke can bring no better proofes or examples thereof than he hath heere done, doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly iuſtifie his aduerſary, and plainly declare that his outcry is not vpon occaſion but onely by deuice. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he hath wittingly miſreported ſuch woorthy authours of purpoſe to beguile the credulous Reader, then he hath a moſt ſeared and corrupt conſcience vnwoorthy the name of a Diuine, and walking aliue is dead in conſcience, and conſequently in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with all men that loue the truth, for the tongue that lieth, killeth the ſoule.</hi> Be it ſo; I willingly ſubſcribe the ſentence; the doome is iuſt, and let it ſo befall to him that dealeth in that ſort. <hi>His vntruthes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are ſo plaine and palpable that you need no more but compare his reports with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours words, and at firſt ſight any meane ſcholar ſhall finde his coſinage and deceit.</hi> But therefore haue I now ſet downe the authours words which he hath not done, and thereby the Reader ſhall ſee where <hi>the coſinage and deceit is.</hi> He profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to haue read the places: if he haue done that himſelfe which he imputeth to me, he hath pronounced his owne doome: if God giue him not grace to repent, wo be vnto him, and better had it beene for him that he had neuer been borne.

The Proteſtants giue all authority to the ancient Fathers, ſaue where the Fathers are ouer-ruled by the word of God. The Papiſts ouer-rule the Fathers by their owne Decrees, and the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a buzzardly Pope or of a few blind Biſhops depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon him, muſt be with them of more account and reckoning than all the Fathers of the Church.

I name Elymas the ſorcerer <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to peruert the ſtreight wayes of the Lord;</hi> I note the place where it is ſaid that he did ſo. I mention <hi>Mauzzim</hi> as the god of Antichriſt according to the expoſition of ſundrie of the Fathers; I direct the Reader where it is that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention of him; I tell what the worke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhall be; I expreſſe it by the words of the Apoſtle Peter, which are a Prophecie of the time of Antichriſt, that by himſelfe and his <hi>he ſhall priuily bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and through couetouſneſſe with fained words ſhall make merchandiſe of men.</hi> And that this merchandiſe ſhall be <hi>of the ſoules of men,</hi> I forgate to note it, but ſhould haue done out of <hi>Reuel.</hi> 18.13. where <hi>the ſoules of men</hi> are reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the merchandiſe of the whore of Babylon. And how this ſhall be done, I note by the words of the Apoſtle concerning ſuch deceiuers and falſe teachers, that <hi>they ſpeake things which they ought not for filthy lucres ſake.</hi> Is this now that <hi>diſmembring and renting of Gods word in peeces</hi> that he complaineth of? Surely I haue not diſmembred the word of God, but it ſeemeth his vnderſtanding is diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that can no better conceiue what it is to diſmember the word of God. He is greeued that the word of God fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo rightly to deſcribe the Maſter whom he ſerueth, and for whom hee hath yeelded ſo farre to engage his owne ſoule. But ſaith he, <hi>the words hang vntowardly together; for if his Maieſty ſhould be perſwaded to aduance the idoll Mauz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim the God of Antichriſt, he could not eſtabliſh hereſies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily brought in.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For that falſe God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will wholly oppoſe himſelfe againſt Chriſt, and openly profeſſe idolatry and compell others to doe the ſame.</hi> And euen ſo doth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:643:229"/>the Pope, euen ſo, I ſay, the Pope doth wholly oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt Chriſt, perſecute the faith of Chriſt, tread vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet the lawes of Chriſt, openly profeſſe idolatry, and compell others to doe the ſame. But he is ſaid <hi>priuily to bring indamnable hereſies,</hi> not becauſe he doth not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe them, but becauſe he bringeth them in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, by goodly pretences and colourable ſhewes, by fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; faire gloſſing words, hiding therewith ſo much as he can the iniquity and impiety that is contained in them. In which ſort Saint Paul ſaith, that

               <hi>the ſpirits of errour</hi> ſhall <hi>ſpeake lies in hypocriſie,</hi> ſo that though the doctrines which they teach be <hi>doctrines of diuels,</hi> yet they ſhall colour them with faire pretences of piety and religion, that they may not ſeeme to be that that indeed they are. For in this ſort the Pope deliuereth all his lies, colouring all with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the name of Chriſt. He is the vicar of Chriſt and whatſoeuer he doth, he doth it by the authority of Chriſt. He ſetteth vp faires and markets for ſelling and buying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, and we muſt thinke that he doth it by a power receiued from Chriſt. He teacheth men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatry in the worſhipping of images, but he beareth them in hand that therein they honour Chriſt and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt.

As for <hi>couetouſneſſe and deſire of filthy lucre, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merchandiſe of ſoules</hi> for the ſatisfying thereof, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concerneth Romiſh Prieſts. It is well knowen to the world by what meanes they haue formerly gotten the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world into their hands. By the ſame meanes now do Seminary Prieſts feed their bellies and cloath their backs; if not in ſuch maner as they deſire, it is but with them as many times it is with whoremongers and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:643:230"/>who are content to liue otherwiſe in penury &amp; want, ſo that they may haue but to continue them in their beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and filthy life. But, M. Biſhop, we too well ſee that you and your fellowes haue too little cauſe to complaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A friend of yours could once familiarly tell an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his what baſe reckoning is made of our Miniſters, but for them how they were magnified and honoured, and where they came had all things at command. The trueth is, that according to the world it is better with you than it is with many of them whom you enuy for their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and Deanries, and many other alſo that are honeſter than you be. As for Tyburne you haue not to feare it for religion but for treaſon only, becauſe you yeeld your loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and fidelity from your Souereigne and naturall Prince to an vſurping forren Prieſt. So long as you doe ſo, whatſoeuer your colours be, iuſtly ſhall Tyburne belong to you. I know how much adoe you haue made both in the beginning and end of your booke to acquit your ſelfe in that behalfe. You ſhot out your bolt to the King, <hi>God knoweth what that forcible weapon of neceſſitie may constraine and driue men vnto at the length.</hi> You are deſirous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs that that was but a friendly caution againſt that you feared might come to paſſe, not any threatning of any thing to be done. And although the words were vſed when the powder-treaſon was in hand, yet it was not meant therof, neither were any of their part conſenting or willing to it but <hi>a few greene heads, ſome raſh vnaduiſed Catholicks for the greater part decayed in their eſtates.</hi> But his diſloiall and traiterous minde therein appeareth, that he thus drei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this matter to <hi>a few greene heads,</hi> when as by courſe of legall proceeding and by the Kings Maieſties Declaration to forren States it is made manifeſt that that helliſh deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had the priuity and conſent of ſundry their principall Ieſuites, and there were then commonly amongſt them all prayers for the ſucceſſe of ſome ſpeciall enterpriſe in their behalfe, though they knew not what it was. For my part

I ſmile at his folly heerin, and can not withall but pitie him, that he hath not ſo much wit as to thinke that euery man will wonder, that againſt ſuch a writer and ſuch an anſwer he ſhould not be able in three yeeres and more to defend ſo much as his Epiſtle to the King, yea and that to make good that which he ſaith, he can bring no better excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than he hath heere done. I ſee that he is not willing to make ſale of me; he would faine haue me ſticke ſtil to him, and ſo, God willing, I will, till my rags haue choaked him, and my threed-bare ſtuffe haue worne him ſo bare, as that

And heere firſt I wiſh thee to obſerue how, that he may lay an imputation of vntruth vpon me, he ſticketh not to eat and deny his owne words.

               <hi>You in the weightier part falſly ſlander me, which I will proue euen by your owne testimonie; for I ſay, as it may be ſeene in your owne booke, that I will let paſſe their impietie that make God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all wickedneſſe, and ſay nothing of their blaſphemy who touch our Sauiour with doubting, if not with deſpaire of his owne ſaluation; in which ſpeech I tax by the way Caluin and Beza and ſom other, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas both in my booke and in his owne his words are generall as touching the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants religion which the King profeſſeth:

               <hi>They who defended the law did induce them (the Coloſſians) to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Angels, ſaying that the Law was giuen by them. And this corruption continued long in Phrygia and Piſidia. Wherefore the Councell of Laodicea the chiefe City of Phrygia, did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree forbid to pray to Angels. And euen to this day we may ſee amongst them and others neere to them Chapels of S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael. And this they perſwaded pretending humility, ſaying that the Lord of all might not be ſeene nor comprehended nor come vnto, and that by the Angels we muſt procure or obtaine the good will or fauour of God. And this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Apoſtle meant by humility and worſhip of Angels.</hi> And what doth M. Biſhop now ſay to this? The Councell forſooth meant it
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Reproofe pag. 238.</note> 
               <hi>of leauing our Sauiour, Ieſus Chriſt, to commit idolatry to the Angels, preferring the Angels before him.</hi> But Theoderet knew well the meaning of the Councell. Theodoret knew the occaſion of that decree, namely a ſuperſtition brought in by the falſe Apoſtles to worſhip Angels and to pray to them, and that vnder the ſame pretence by which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts excuſe their praying to Saints and Angels, that we may not preſume immediately to goe to God himſelfe, but muſt by them procure fauour and make way to him. This ſuperſtition continued, he ſaith, in Phrygia and Piſidia. They builded Oratories and Chapels in the names of the Angels whither they aſſembled themſelues for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this deuotion. This ſaith Theodoret was the thing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:643:236"/>which the Councell condemned. Yea, but <hi>ſee the Canon,</hi> ſaith M. Biſhop, <hi>and you ſhall finde M.

               <hi>That it behoueth not Chriſtians forſaking Gods Church to goe and call to the Angels, or to make aſſemblies, which is forbidden; if any man therefore be found to giue himſelfe to this ſecret idolatry, accurſed be he, becauſe he hath forſaken our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and hath reſorted to idolatry.</hi> Marke well the Canon, I pray thee, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou canſt finde that I haue committed any legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, or whether it be not rather one of M. Biſhops trickes of legerdemaine, thus to obiect the ſame to me, that he in the meane time may be thought to be free from it, with whom indeed is no other but legerdemaine. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell plainly inſtructeth vs that to pray to angels is idolatry; that the aſſemblies of thoſe ſuperſtitious people to pray to Angels were aſſemblies of idolatry; and that to forſake the Church to goe to pray to Angels, is to forſake Chriſt and to repaire to idolatry, leauing vs thereby conſequently to vnderſtand, that to bring inuocation of Angels into the Church, as the Papiſts haue done, is to bring idolatry thereinto. M. Biſhop would make vs beleeue that the Councell meaneth not that it is vnlawfull to pray to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but ſo to pray to them as to forſake Chriſt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them before Chriſt, whereas the Councell ſaieth not a word of preferring the Angels before Chriſt, nor ſpeaketh of forſaking Chriſt, but it ſaith that to forſake the church to goe to pray to angels, is to forſake our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to runne to idolatry, plainely reſoluing that to pray to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is idolatry and in no ſort to be receiued in the Church of Chriſt. We conclude therefore againſt M. Biſhop, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:643:236"/>the Church of Rome in praying to angels doth commit idolatry, and is not now all one with the ancient Church of Rome that did condemne the ſame. This then is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage that M. Biſhop hath gotten by referring his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Canon, that we are to account his talke of leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine but as <hi>the preaching of the fox,</hi> crying out vpon falſehood that he himſelfe may the more ſecurely practiſe it, as I might further ſhew, but that for a taſte I haue ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough already by his anſwers concerning Carpocrates and Marcellina and concerning a Canon of the Councell of Gangra in the very ſame place.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:643:239"/>ſetting downe plainly the authours words in their owne tongue, as I haue done, to make it appeare, if it bee ſo, that in charging me with falſhood and lying, hee hath done the part of a truſty and honeſt man, being no further ſo to be taken, if hauing made ſuch a clamour againſt me of lying, lying, it now prooue to be but a cry of courſe, not for any matter in me, but onely of forme in him.

Tell his friends and followers, that if in theſe few matters hee cannot better acquit himſelfe, it ſhall be a ſhame for them to ſuffer themſelues any longer to bee deluded by ſuch a ſhameleſſe man. If he ſay he will doe it in his ſecond part, vnderſtand that he doth but mocke thee.

               <hi>becauſe no man can ſhew any written commandement thereof, it is manifest that the Apoſtles left it free to euery mans will and diſcretion that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or neceſſity euery man ſhould doe what good is.</hi> Now we cannot wonder that he that would thus vnaduiſedly name Apoſtolike tradition for the one, ſhould do the ſame for the other alſo. Albeit if M. Higgons can iuſtifie praier for the dead according to Docter Fields rule, we will not ſticke with him to grant it to be an Apoſtolicall tradition. But he might haue ſeene that I had put it without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of that rule, if he had been deſirous to know the truth and had not reſolued firſt vpon other occaſions to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and afterwards to ſeeke ſhifts to excuſe his fall. I ſhewed by Origen that the Church at firſt vſed no praier for the dead; by the authour of the eccleſiaſticall Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy that when it was firſt vſed, it was vſed onely for iuſt and holy men of whoſe ſoules they were reſolued that they were in heauen, for what cauſes I haue expreſſed there; by Epiphanius, that they added afterwards to pray for euill men alſo and publicke offenders; by Auſtin that there was not knowen any definite and certaine vſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of praiers and offerings for the dead, and that many in his time did plead that if any good were to be done for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:643:241"/>the ſoule after death it ſhould rather be by it owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes than by offerings procured by other men. And laſtly whereas praier for the dead by M. Higgons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion dependeth vpon Purgatory, I ſhewed by Auſtins expreſſe words that he had no certaine beleefe or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any ſuch place, which are more cleere to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than that by any Popiſh ſophiſtications they can be ſhifted or deluded.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Albeit I did not only alledge him doubting of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but alſo plainly excluding it vpon occaſion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any third place. This deniall of a third place M. Higgons
<note n="z" place="margin">Book 1. part 1. ch. 2. § 4. num. 10.</note> acknowledgeth, and noteth me in his margent for citing the places where it is denied, but ſeeketh to auoid it by ſaying that Auſtin thereby onely denied againſt the Pelagians any third place of eternall reſt heere vpon earth after the day of iudgement for children dying without baptiſme; for this is the briefe of the differences that hee hath there ſet downe. But this will not ſerue his turne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Auſtin doth not meerely deny their third place, but from the abſolute denial of a third place inferreth that their third place cannot be.

               <hi>he doth wrong to a martyr that praieth for him.</hi> But let M. Higgons wrangle heereof all hee can, by the very place of Epiphanius, that which I ſay is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euicted. For when he ſaith, that <hi>wee often are deceiued and goe awry ſo long as we are in this world;</hi> hee thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the cauſe why they did make that memorial both for the ſinners and for the iuſt, there being none ſo iuſt but that that is verified in them, <hi>that they are often deceiued and go awry.</hi> Now will M. Higgons make Epiphanius to ſay of the Saints and iuſt men, that becauſe ſo long as they were in this world they were often deceiued and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, therefore now wee giue thanks for them? It were very abſurd to ſay ſo; but the other way the words are cleer, that becauſe we are all ſubiect to ſinne, therefore we pray for all. And if by this it be not plaine enough, the reſt ſhall make it more plaine. For out of this reaſon iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another of as great effect, when he ſaith, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall is made for iuſt and holy men, <hi>that we may ſeparate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:643:244"/>our Lord Ieſus Chriſt from the order of men, by the honour that we do vnto him.</hi> Which <hi>honour</hi> wherein it ſtandeth, is vnderſtood by thoſe former words, <hi>that that which is more perfect may be ſignified;</hi> noting it to be the acknowledging of his moſt high and glorious perfection; he onely being free from all ſpot and ſtaine of ſinne and vncleanneſſe, but all other carying the marks of frailty and corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened, not in giuing thanks, as I hope M. Higgons will confeſſe, but rather in praying for them. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he yet further more plainly addeth thoſe other words, <hi>And that we may yeeld worſhip to him.</hi> But how? <hi>Waighing in our mindes that there is no man compared to him, though a man liue in righteouſneſſe a thouſand times and more.</hi> By which words it is cleere as the light, that that <hi>ſeparation</hi> whereof hee ſpeaketh, hath no intendment of the difference which M. Higgons mentioneth of giuing thanks <hi>to the one and for the other,</hi> but that it concerneth righteouſneſſe and ſinne, it being to be knowen by this <hi>memoriall,</hi> that all the Saints, euen they that atteined to the greateſt meaſure of righteouſnes, yet being <hi>men,</hi> were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to infirmities and imperfections; that ſo Chriſt alone may haue the glory to be tranſcendent and beyond the condition of fraile and ſinfull fleſh. Now becauſe no part of this could be imported in that <hi>memoriall,</hi> if it were a thankeſgiuing for the Saints, therefore whether M. Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons will or not, it muſt neceſſarily be taken to haue been a praier for them. And heereof there is one argument more in the laſt part of the compariſon, when he ſaith of Chriſt that <hi>he is in heauen,</hi> and of the Saints that <hi>they are in the earth by their bodies yet resting in the earth.</hi> Where it hath ſome reaſon that they ſhould ſay, We pray for them as reſpecting that their bodies lie yet in the duſt of the earth, expecting a bleſſed and happy reſurrection, which we craue to bee reuealed vpon them, but to ſay that they meant to giue thanks to God for that the bodies of the Saints lie buried in the earth, it were ſenſleſſe and abſurd.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:643:244"/>And becauſe it is confirmed vnto vs by the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, that the Church did pray for the dead, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the reſurrection, therefore wee cannot doubt but that <hi>the memoriall</hi> heere ſpoken of by Epiphanius, vſed for the Saints in reſpect of their bodies in the earth, was a praier for them to wiſh their full and perfect conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the reſurrection from the dead. My former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion therefore hence deduced, ſtandeth good, that ſith the ancient Church thus praied for the Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, therefore that certaine it is, they did not pray vnto them. And becauſe they thus praied for the Saints, whoſe ſoules they were aſſured were in heauen, therefore they praied for the dead without reſpect of Purgatory, which now is made the onely ground and reaſon of praier for the dead.</p>
            <p n="38">38. The next matter for which he queſtioneth me is concerning the opinion of the Greeke churches as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purgatory and prayer for the dead.

               <hi>That the Protceſtants make God the authour of ſinne, the only cauſe of ſinne, that man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, that God is worſe than the diuell.</hi> If Luther haue any where in that leand and impious maner calumniated the Church of Rome, I will not deny but that M. Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons ſhould haue cauſe to ſtile him afoul-mouthed dogge; but if he haue not ſo done, then is M. Higgons to blame
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:643:246"/>to aſſigne to him that which of right belongeth to another man. Whom indeed we thinke to be a man of ſome kind of learning whereby he can audaciouſly and impetuouſly wrangle where he may haue his way; but he that would giue forth to the world for <hi>forcible reaſons</hi> ſuch miſſhapen ſtuffe, as ſpecially ſome of thoſe are which he hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, is very far from the woorth, where he is vprightly iudged, to be accounted <hi>a very learned Priest.</hi>

            <p n="41">41. His laſt matter touching me concerneth a difference betwixt Doct. Field and me. Doct. Field thinketh that the cauſe why Aerius was condemned of hereticall raſhnes, was <hi>for that he durſt condemne the laudable cuſtome of the commemoration of the dead by way of giuing thankes for them.</hi> Againſt this opinion of Docter Field hee produceth mee amongſt others for a witneſſe, though mangling and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my words to other purpoſe in ſome ſort than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them. But the ſumme of all is, that I hold it to haue beene the cauſe why Aerius was taxed of hereſie for that he reprehended and denied praiers and offerings for the dead. Whereupon D. Field groundeth his opinion I cannot tell: by Epiphanius and Auſtin I conceiue that it is right which I haue ſaid. But vpon this occaſion M. Higgons, becauſe I had ſaid that Auſtin and the Papiſts as touching the end of praier for the dead, did agree <hi>like harpe and harrow,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth my phraſe and ſaith; <hi>Doe not theſe men agree like harpe and harrow?</hi> Where I cannot but thinke that he was very idlely diſpoſed and wanted matter that would ſo much trouble himſelfe as hee hath done with a difference of ſo ſmall effect. If Doct. Field conceiue rightly of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Aerius, then in the condemning of Aerius we al accord with him. If we conceiue more truely of Aerius that it was praier for the dead which he impugned, then in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Aerius Docter Field accordes with vs. And may we not thinke this to be a great matter to trouble M. Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons minde? Did he ſee no greater differences than this in the Church of Rome? Had he not found in Bellarmine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:643:246"/>concerning ſundry waighty points of faith, <hi>a first opinion of ſuch a one, a ſecond opinion of ſuch a one, a third, yea a fourth opinion of ſuch and ſuch?</hi> To let other matters goe, did you not M. Higgons remember your two great Cardinals, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius and Bellarmine ſtanding in great difference, the one that it is directly, the other that it is indirectly, that the Pope hath a power ouer Kings and Princes to depoſe them; yea and another opinion regnant amongſt many of your great Diuines, that the Pope hath no ſuch authority either way, and that they are but Paraſites and pickthankes that ſooth him in ſo vniuſt and vndue a claime? Goe, M. Higgons, goe and tell your owne Cardinals, <hi>haec eſt menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum natura vt probè cohaerere non poſſint,</hi> for the third o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion prooueth them to bee liars on both ſides. As for your ſelfe you are now become one of thoſe <hi>pedling mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> in the exerciſe of whoſe trade you ſhall indeed finde it true, that <hi>they cannot thriue at all vnleſſe they can lie much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42. I pity your folly, M. Higgons, and cannot but for your friends ſake lament that miſerable ſtate whereinto you haue wilfully caſt your ſelfe. Surely it was a ſtrong and a ſtrange humour that poſſeſſed both your head and your heart, that could driue you to this extremity for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and prayer for the dead. Doubtleſſe it was not Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory nor praier for the dead that you reſpected; but when you had reſolued to run into this ruine, you thought theſe points moſt plauſible and ready whence your wit might weaue ſome ſpiders webs for the hiding of your ſhame. I doubt not M. Higgons, but if you were heere as you would wiſh to be, you are able your ſelfe to ſhew that all you haue ſaid is no other but a ſpiders web. God giue you grace to vnderſtand what you haue done, that if it be poſſible you may returne againe out of the ſnare of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and out of that hell of inward terrours whereinto you haue deſperately plunged your owne ſoule. I know you are in the hands of Gryphes and Vultures that doe not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily let goe the prey that they haue once ſeazed vpon, but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:643:247"/>I commend you to his mercy who is able to doe more than we can any way expect of you.</p>
            <p n="43">43. And ſo for the time I leaue both M. Biſhop and M. Higgons, but with minde ſpeedily to take M. Biſhop in hand againe. The meane while, gentle Reader, I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee this Aduertiſement for ſome ſatisfaction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his late booke, that thou maieſt with the more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence expect the full anſwer thereof. And albeit I haue heere made it appeare that he hath proſtituted his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſet himſelfe to ſale, to ſay and face and outface any thing to ſerue the Popes and his owne turne, ſo as that heereby he hath voided himſelfe of that credit which hee would detract from me, and his booke ſhall remaine for no other but the record of his owne ſhame, yet I will not ſo leaue him but will goe forward, if God will, more thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pull the vizard from his face and to make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in thoſe colours that doe belong vnto him. Aſſiſt mee with thy praiers vnto God for the doing of the worke of God, that it may be to his glory, to the conuincing of the aduerſarie, and to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the church of Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
